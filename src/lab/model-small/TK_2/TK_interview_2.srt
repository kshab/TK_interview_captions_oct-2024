00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,440
Thank you, Tom. Let's move to the second chapter, which is called Air War. The first

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:20,600
question will be about Russian Cubs, guided bombs. There are reports that Russia has increased

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:29,560
the range of its Cubs from 30 kilometers up to even 80 kilometers. The question is how

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,440
much further can this range be increased? Okay, first start. Russia didn't increase the range.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,880
The range was 60 to 70 kilometers already last year. This is simply physics. And this physics

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,080
comes from the weight of the weapon combined with the speed of the aircraft carrying it. At

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:57,440
the time it's released, plus the attitude of the aircraft. At the time it's released in the bomb.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:09,040
So what happens, SO-34 comes in at an altitude between 9,000 and 12,000 meters at a high subsonic

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:19,040
speed, which means something like 1,100 kilometers per hour. So then it enters a shallow

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,800
climb, flies like this, and releases the bomb. The bombs drop from the aircraft, open their wings,

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:36,280
and then they glide over 60 to 70 kilometers in a parabolic trajectory until hitting the ground.

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:44,400
So the point is now the following. Depending on the sector of the front line, where they deploy

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,840
such bombs, in some cases, Russians are free to fly their SO-34s all the way over the Ukrainian

14
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,560
positions. For example, in Wuchleda area, the last two weeks, they were free to fly over Wuchleda.

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,080
Because the glorious general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces didn't take care to deploy at least

16
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,920
proper air defenses on that place. Therefore, they could reach 70 kilometers behind Wuchleda.

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:27,640
But in other sectors, for example, Kursk, they can't. In Kursk, the Ukrainian air defenses are strong

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,160
enough that the Russians have to release their bombs from 70 kilometers away, from, let's say,

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,040
50 kilometers behind their front line, to reach a target only 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian

20
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,360
front line, 10 to 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian front line. And then it appears to

21
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,640
plenty of people that the range is shorter than just 30 kilometers. In other cases,

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,920
the Russians do not need to hit something that is further away than 30 kilometers. So they are

23
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,840
releasing their bombs and they are striking targets just 30 kilometers away. Because the target is

24
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,000
simply closer and less well protected. So, correspondingly, the range was always 60 to 70

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,560
kilometers. And now it might be increased to around 100 kilometers with the help of rocket

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,240
boosters. That means there's a rocket engine, rocket motor, sorry, installed on the rear,

27
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,360
at the rear of the of the UMPK. And this is empowering the bomb. And instead of glide bomb,

28
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,760
it's becoming a guided missile de facto. So that is the answer to your question.

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:42,200
That's clear, Tom. Is it is it true that Russians already developed not

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:54,440
far flying Cubs, but also more powerful Cubs? I mean that more more heavier ones. For example,

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:05,160
everyone knows about Cup 500. But some people already say about Cup 900 or something like that.

32
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,880
Okay, let me clarify this. In the Soviet and therefore Russian Air Force, you have specific

33
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:22,480
calibers of bombs, 250 kilogram, 500 kilogram, 1000, 1500 kilogram, 3000, 5000 and 9000 kilogram

34
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,600
bombs. Okay, these are the biggest bombs. A FAB, Fugas, an aviation, a bomb, 5000,

35
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:38,480
9000 was the biggest one. And this 9000 means it is 9000 kilogram heavy or somewhere like that.

36
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:46,800
So correspondingly, for a 9000 kilogram bomb, you need a bomb which can carry a bomb weighting 9 tons.

37
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:56,520
That is the first point. The second point is, in order to make a glide bomb out of such a bomb,

38
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,400
you need very big wings, big wing surface. And the bigger the wing surface, the further it's flying.

39
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,040
Which in turn means you need the bomb itself is getting ever grow bigger and bigger.

40
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:19,600
Correspondingly, there is a big problem already with the bomb in caliber of 3000 kilogram of 3 tons.

41
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:28,720
The construction, this UMP key construction, this module which is installed on top of the bomb,

42
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,120
splitting wings, so it becomes a glide bomb, is so big and so heavy that the bomb is weighting

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,560
something like 4 tons. That means that a single SO-34 can only carry one at once, also because of

44
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,680
its sheer size. It is not only the size, it is the weight as well, because you have to consider,

45
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,320
you put a 4000 kilogram bomb under an aircraft and to connect it to the aircraft, you need a hard point,

46
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,400
which is, we call this pylon in English, which can carry 4000 kilogram.

47
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,480
And this pylon weights another 1000 kilogram. So now you have 4000 kilogram of a bomb,

48
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,920
1000 kilogram of the pylon and then you put that on the aircraft, on SO-34, in between the engines.

49
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,680
And you have, in this way, you have put 4000 kilogram on the aircraft.

50
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,920
SO-34 could theoretically carry 8000 kilogram of bombs, but then it's going to fly for the next 200 kilometers.

51
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:42,880
But because of the threat of Russian bases, they have moved SO-34s away from bases close to Ukraine,

52
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,920
therefore they have to fly very far away, from very far away, from warground in similar places,

53
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,280
and therefore they carry only one such bomb at once. So that is theory. Why? Because so far,

54
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,680
all I've seen, the biggest I've seen as deployed, was 1500 kilogram.

55
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,480
You're talking only about Russians or?

56
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,880
Russians, Russians, just Russians. 1500 kilogram. It could be that they have dropped

57
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,040
one or two, 3000, there are prototypes of 3000 kilogram heavy UMPK or carb bomb, if you like it.

58
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,800
It could be they have deployed two or three of this, but I haven't seen any clear evidence,

59
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,080
any definite evidence that there is such a weapon in serious production in Russia.

60
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,440
At least not its UMPK module. There are 3000 kilogram bombs in Russian arsenals,

61
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,400
and they are in production as well, but there are no UMPK modules which can be installed on such bombs

62
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,720
and manufactured in serious. So most of the times they're actually dropping bombs,

63
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,880
UMPK bombs or carb bombs, if you like, of 250 kilogram and 500 kilogram. From time to time,

64
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:07,360
they're dropping those of 1000, 1500 kilogram. But 3000 kilogram, I haven't seen clear evidence for

65
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,640
any so far. Even somewhere throughout the world, not only in Ukraine?

66
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,520
When we're talking about around the world. Yes, the question is, are there any examples of

67
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,880
applying such huge stuff, at least somewhere, maybe on the Middle East or somewhere else?

68
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,520
Okay, I see now what you mean. Here we have to distinguish between bombs designed and manufactured,

69
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,440
originally manufactured in Soviet Union, and nowadays in Russia, and between Western bombs.

70
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,040
Why? Because Western bombs are made of parts which should assemble together as necessary.

71
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,560
They are very flexible, they are modular, but they are construction. On Soviet dash Russian bombs,

72
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,080
everything is welded together. That's it. Bomb is delivered to the air base as it was manufactured,

73
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,000
as it was put together already in the factory. You can't change anything about it. So the question,

74
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,720
fundamental question or the fundamental issue while developing the carb or the UMPK

75
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,600
was how to make a module which you can put on such a bomb which is already ready for use.

76
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,920
And this means that every different caliber of bomb needs a different UMPK module. This module

77
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,320
must be ever bigger and bigger because it needs ever bigger wings so that it can reach this 60 to 70

78
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:48,320
kilometers. Correspondingly, nobody tried to do anything of this kind outside of Russia,

79
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,280
at least not with bombs bigger than 250 kilograms. North Koreans have a similar system,

80
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:07,680
like UMPK, which is useful for bombs caliber 250, perhaps 500 kilograms. And I've seen them in

81
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,440
use by Sudanese Air Force over Yemen, for example. This is also 7 years ago or something like that.

82
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,280
So this is all I have seen in regards to Soviet-Russian bombs. Then it comes to western bombs. The

83
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,080
situation is entirely different because western bombs are modular and you have you can put the

84
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,800
same kit, so-called kit, on different caliber of bombs. You have bombs caliber 125 kilograms,

85
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:43,040
125 kilograms, 250, 500, and 1000, actually 907, but let's say 1000 kilograms. So

86
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,280
you put the same guidance kit and the same set of wings on different caliber of bombs.

87
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,600
You can also use specialized casings or bomb bodies like BLU-109, this is this

88
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,560
bunker-buster bomb of 1000 kilogram caliber, or 2000 pounds, as we have seen when Israel

89
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:17,040
assassinated the Nasrallah. This is a specially hardened casing, which makes sure that bomb penetrates,

90
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,240
you know, goes down through the ground, 20, 30 meters through the ground before detonating.

91
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,200
But the guidance system and the wings system for this bomb is still the same like on any

92
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,720
general bomb, caliber 250 kilometers, because these bodies are all very flexible and modular.

93
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,480
So this is a difference. However, there are no heavier, at least not in widespread tactical

94
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:52,960
service, no heavier air released bombs in western service or of western origin than 1000 kilogram.

95
00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:01,360
There is one type, this massive penetrator, whatever, 10,000 kilogram bomb in the United States,

96
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,520
but this is carried only by B-2 bombers, and that's it, not a tactical aircraft can deploy it.

97
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,800
So the heaviest bombs of this caliber are around 1000 kilograms in the west.

98
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,960
Tom, what about Ukraine? Can Ukraine, for example, use our favorite F-16s to apply such stuff?

99
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,760
Yes, of course. You could put two 1000 kilogram bombs on F-16.

100
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,400
What do you think? Is Ukrainian command going to use it?

101
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,600
Yes, you have already underdeveloped such a weapon. I'm just not sure if it is caliber 1000 kilogram,

102
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
but you certainly have such underdevelopment, a weapon of 500 kilogram.

103
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,400
That's very interesting. So let's stay on our favorite topic. Tom, how could you,

104
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
what's your opinion of the

105
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,960
using of western aircraft in Ukraine?

106
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Look, in order to use western aircraft in Ukraine, you have to change the entire system,

107
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,600
how aviation is operating in Ukraine, and this is happening very, very slowly.

108
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:27,280
It took the delivery of F-16s to Ukraine for the top civilian authority in Ukraine,

109
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:35,760
I forgot the name, sorry now, to write a new set of regulations for pilots, for ground personnel,

110
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,240
for ground control and so on, and for radar systems and so on. So before that, you still had

111
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,080
the same system like in the Soviet Union. So now you have to, in order to use, the next step in

112
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,600
using western aircraft is to teach your people, your troops, your ground crews and your pilots to

113
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,200
speak English, which is the next hurdle because despite all the talk about we are going to buy

114
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,040
western aircraft, whether a sub-grip pen or F-16s or whatever else, of the last let's say 10 years

115
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,920
or something like that, nobody in the Air Force took here to organize English language courses

116
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,200
for pilots and for ground personnel, which means that every time Ukraine sends pilots and ground

117
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,720
personnel for training in the West, they first have to spend six months at least learning English.

118
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,320
So now once they learn English, only then can they start training actual flying training or aircraft.

119
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,800
Before they start this actual training, flight training on aircraft, they have to learn the

120
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,160
basic principles, procedures of flying in the West, which are fundamentally different than those in

121
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,120
the former Soviet Union. So even then, actually, they still do not instantly start training in

122
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:09,760
aircraft, but they first learn the procedures and terminology in order to start learning flying

123
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,960
aircraft or maintaining aircraft or arming them, refueling them and so on and so on. So you have

124
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,520
every time a new group of Ukrainians is sent to West to learn flying F-16s or whatever else,

125
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,720
it takes at least a year to get them so far that they start actually learning to fly the aircraft.

126
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,080
Correspondingly, from this point of view, you can instantly calculate how long is it going to take

127
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:45,920
for an entire Ukrainian Air Force to convert to, let's say, F-16s. This is just F-16s.

128
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
Another part is going to convert to Gripens. At least a unit is going to fly

129
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,920
this Sub-Evox aircraft and similar stuff.

130
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
So this is a process that is going to take years.

131
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:15,840
Can we say that today is too early to make conclusions about applying F-16s and other

132
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,720
aircraft in Ukraine? It's not too early. It's not too early. Don't worry. Let's say,

133
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,280
even if the Dutch would junk all of their 40 or whatever F-16s that are still around

134
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,160
up on Ukraine tomorrow in the morning, it will still take you one to two years to train enough

135
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,640
personnel to fly all of them. You do not have people enough people. Someone is already flying.

136
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,040
Just flying over Ukraine. You don't have enough pilots. You don't have enough ground personnel.

137
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,840
You don't have the support infrastructure. You don't have the spares. You don't have

138
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,560
maintenance facilities in Ukraine. You don't have it. It's simply not there.

139
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:05,840
You mean that those aircraft which already fly above Ukraine, they do not conduct any military

140
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:13,440
mission? Oh, no. I do not say that. What do they do? There are five F-16s in Ukraine. This is the

141
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,080
group that was delivered two months ago, and they are flying air combat sorties, air defense sorties.

142
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,280
I'm not dispute about this. But increasing this number to, let's say, 30 or something meaningful

143
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,840
to a number that is making sense or having its effect upon developments on the battlefield,

144
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:51,040
it's going to take its time. Okay, that's clear. We also had a question that is being asked throughout

145
00:17:51,040 --> 00:18:02,960
Ukraine for about three years. Why don't we still have our own iron dome above Ukraine?

146
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:15,440
What's about Ukrainian air defense? Where should I start? Well, I mean, you are Ukrainian. You

147
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440
know it better than me. You grew up in Ukraine, if nothing else. I've never been to Ukraine.

148
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,200
The first problem is that from the independence in 1991, 1992, until 2014, nobody cared about

149
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,920
Ukrainian armed forces. So they were constantly decreased, decreased, decreased, decreased,

150
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:42,000
downsized, downsized. Units were constantly disbanded. Air bases were closed. Nobody needed

151
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,880
armed forces. There was peace everywhere. Everything was so beautiful. And well, it's a matter of

152
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,880
fact that Ukrainian economy wasn't particularly good. So you had a situation where there was no money

153
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,480
for the city. And therefore, although you had excellent companies which could

154
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,080
design a manufacturing weaponry, nobody was buying this weaponry. And so these companies,

155
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,400
in some cases, ended working for the Russians and not only a few of them. So when the Russians needed

156
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,200
some kind of guided, tactical guided weapons, air-to-air missiles and so on, these were made,

157
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,840
at least major parts of them, major assemblies of them were made in Ukraine.

158
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,520
And then the Russians would either use these at home or sell them abroad, export them

159
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,800
to whatever customers. So now the 2014 came and there are lots of announcements and blah, blah,

160
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:50,240
blah, blah. And nothing happened. Or the most that has happened was to overhaul MiG-29s and S-25s

161
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,440
very few, F-22s, S-27s. So they were overhauled. That means that they were taken apart,

162
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,360
cleaned, refurbished, most important pieces were replaced. And then everything was assembled,

163
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,200
painted anew. And they received a new radio, they received new weapons management systems.

164
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,200
MiG-29s have even received this new computer, which is improving the performance of their radar.

165
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,640
Beautiful. Yeah. And that's it. Nobody came to the idea, obviously, to finance the installation of

166
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,600
or development research and installation of actually serious production and installation

167
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,600
of new air-to-air missiles on MiG-29s or S-27s. So this is the first point. The second point is

168
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,920
in order to have such weaponry, whether air-to-air missiles or surface-to-air missiles,

169
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:54,800
you should have had somebody who would manufacture them. Basically, you had several design bureaus

170
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:06,000
like Luch, for example, who have designs of new air-to-air missile and its surface launched version

171
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,760
with a range of something like 100 kilometers, which is something which your armed forces

172
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,360
would need urgently right now, and then not in a few examples, but in thousands. But it's not there.

173
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,480
Why? Well, because obviously, somebody there is convinced that these are old companies,

174
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,800
that they are too complex and they're wasting too much money and doing nothing and they're

175
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:40,880
useful and to whatever else. Therefore, nothing is done. And now, even if Luch would start,

176
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,800
actually give Artyom the production to launch this production, the serious production of this

177
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,240
new weaponry, it would take at least a year to introduce it to service. On the other side,

178
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,400
meanwhile, Artyom was heavily hit several times by the Russians this summer, so I don't even know

179
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,840
how much of its underground facilities are still actually operational. So why didn't this happen?

180
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:12,080
Because nobody in Kiev had the far side enough to say, okay, guys, we have to build up,

181
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,680
we have to invest into our defense sector, we have to reform it on time and then let it

182
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,240
start manufacturing new weaponry on time. Nothing happened in these regards, actually, even as of,

183
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,760
was it Autumn 2022, perhaps in Autumn the last year. And therefore, you do not have

184
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,600
in serious production, you do not have new ballistic missiles, you do not have air-to-air

185
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,880
missiles, you do not have surface-to-air missiles, although your companies have ready to use designs

186
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,960
for them and they could put them into production. The next point is also that there is always this

187
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,840
petty bickering about who is going to get the money for this. You have advisors to the

188
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,160
government who are complaining that Artyom and Luch, they are old and this is too complex,

189
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,680
and let's not give them money. Let's get this stuff from the West, which is nonsensical.

190
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,960
It would have been better to pay Artyom already back in 2022 to start manufacturing this new

191
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,000
air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles. However, the government back then was convinced

192
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
now this war is going to end, whatever, in the six months, 12 months or something.

193
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Therefore, you didn't launch production on time. Even the Neptune anti-ship missile,

194
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,920
which is meanwhile also developed as a cruise missile, was available on in prototype form,

195
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:50,160
some 12 or 15 examples around in February 2022. This first successful deployment against

196
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,280
Russian guided missile cruiser Moskva was actually something like an ultimate test of the weapon.

197
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:04,000
Before that, there was no operational unit in the Ukrainian Armed Forces operating

198
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,840
Neptune's. And ever since, how many are manufactured? 15 perhaps a year. 15 a year,

199
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,480
where you could need actually, let's say at least 500 of them, and probably then develop them

200
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,280
into land attack versions, which could be launched from Asia 24, so you don't need to beg

201
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,400
Germans, British, French and the Americans for more storm shadows and similar stuff.

202
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,480
You could have had all of this already years ago. Your government just failed to reorganize the

203
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,360
defense sector, to finance it properly, to launch the production. Right now, your defense sector is

204
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:56,320
working with 40 to 60 percent of its capacity, which means actually that people are sitting there

205
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,600
and working something like let's say four to five hours a day instead of eight hours a day in three

206
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:09,360
shifts. This is insane. You're facing a war of extermination and your defense sector is sitting

207
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,080
there and waiting for better times. Because there's nobody in Kiev capable of reorganizing

208
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,200
the financing of the sector and then the management of the sector itself. Nothing is happening.

209
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,680
There are always big announcements, but until somebody from the West comes in,

210
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,040
pays a lot of money probably somewhere, and then invests a lot of money into one or the other

211
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,280
factory, nothing happens. And that is why you don't have modern air-to-air missiles for your

212
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,640
suhuis and for your mix, and why you don't have enough surface-to-air missiles, and why

213
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,800
therefore the entire production and the entire defense sector's future functionality

214
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,080
is under a big question mark.
