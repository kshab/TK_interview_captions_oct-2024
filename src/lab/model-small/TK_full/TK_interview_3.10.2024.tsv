0	10640	Great, greetings to everyone who is watching us, hope you all are safe.
10640	16640	My name is Konstantin Shabalev, and today we together with my colleague, media expert
16640	20920	Sergey Chernevsky are happy to introduce our guest.
20920	26960	It's Tom Cooper, military historian, writer and analyst from Austria.
26960	35960	Tom himself has Austria's Mozart, not kangaroo, but I hope that our audience is educated enough not to confuse.
35960	38960	Hello, Tom, how are you?
38960	42960	Hello, thank you, fine, nice to be with you today.
42960	52960	Great, so among other things, Tom is known in Ukraine as an author of regular updates on the Russian-Ukrainian war.
52960	62960	And almost six months have passed since our first interview, a lot of things changed, and we'd like to discuss them with Tom.
62960	76960	We tried to divide our conversation in several sections, like Tom does in his updates, so the first chapter of our talk is called the Ground War.
76960	88960	And the first question is the following, Tom, we are forced to start with a sad topic earlier this week, Ukraine with Derov from Vuhledar.
88960	101960	And you were describing this process almost live, and now we'd like to know your opinion on what consequences will it cause for Ukraine.
101960	124960	Vuhledar, it's a topic, very frustrating topic because this was such a left down of a great unit that was fighting courageously and with huge skill for two years in that place alone,
124960	147960	we talked about the Battle of Moschun, north-west of Kiev, back in March 2022, and was now left down by top political leadership in Ukraine, by the general staff of Ukrainian armed forces, like really, it's in a most shameful way.
147960	159960	And what should I tell you, I mean, it wasn't really an orderly withdrawal, everybody is calling withdrawal in Ukraine.
159960	180960	Actually, the last two or three days, the defenses of the 72nd collapsed, the Russians attacked from three sides, draw in, captured, I don't know how many troops killed, I don't know how many troops, including plenty of wounded troops,
180960	197960	the soldiers of the 72nd have demanded a withdrawal on time, there was no reaction from Kiev at all, as usually, I mean, it is a shameful episode in the history of Ukraine and nothing else.
197960	212960	It is such a meanwhile typical failure of the political and military leadership in the country that I simply, I cannot understand that something of this kind is happening.
212960	240960	And now, what is after, what now, well, what is left of the 72nd Brigade, perhaps 1000 troops who are tired, exhausted, demoralized, who is going to replace them, who is going to replace such an excellent defense position for the next 30 or 40 kilometers in western or northwestern direction, there is nothing.
241960	258960	So when you ask me what is going to happen now or whatever, I'm not sure, I mean, the only thing we can actually expect is Russia, further Russian advance in western and northwestern direction, or northern direction towards Pokrovsk, that's what's going to happen.
258960	270960	And I do not see the Ukrainian armed forces having a strong position on the way to say Pokrovsk. That's the situation.
271960	292960	Okay, we'll talk about the Ukrainian command a bit later and you mentioned Pokrovsk. Our second question was about this place. Russian army continues to slowly advance towards Pokrovsk.
292960	311960	And what do you think, if they do manage to occupy it, what will be their next target? As I understand, it's some kind of point from which they can advance in different ways.
311960	340960	Pokrovsk, that is related to Vukhleda. And to the situation at the political top in Kiev and in the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. If they continue fighting this war the way they are doing this the last year or so, actually the last one and a half year, almost two years, Pokrovsk is lost already now.
340960	351960	It's pointless to fight for it almost, because it's nothing is going to happen over there, except yet more losses for Ukraine and yet more victories for Russia.
351960	375960	Well, this victory is actually laughable, but okay, who cares. Point is this, you have a president who is fighting for some kind of imaginary USAID and spending and wasting his time with some kind of peace plan which he is then traveling to the United States and presenting it there and to Biden and to Trump and so on.
375960	392960	And what peace plan? What peace plan? There is only one party in this war which can stop this war immediately. And this is Russia, this is Putin. He can stop immediately. Ukraine has no chance to do anything of that kind.
392960	407960	The United States has no chance of doing that. Germany has no chance. Whoever else has no chance. But Russia can stop it. But Russia has absolutely no reason to stop it, because everything is working straight into Putin's hands.
407960	423960	Then the next point. Expecting the Americans now to start providing sufficient support for Ukraine to win this war, to at least liberate some kind of serious portion of territory inside Ukraine is not going to happen.
424960	439960	If nobody in Ukraine has realized this by now, well, it's about the time for somebody to start realizing it finally. But this is also not happening. So you are wasting, your political leadership is wasting time for some kind of fantasies around.
439960	464960	The only thing I've seen him doing that is making sense in the last, let's say, two weeks was this conference with different manufacturers and designers of modern weaponry and trying to attract them into investing into Ukrainian sector of manufacturing defense equipment, ammunition and weaponry.
464960	486960	And this is all. And this is also too little. And going also in some kind chaotic direction, because what is happening? You have, for example, Denmark financing the production of Bohdan self-propelled howitzer in Ukraine.
486960	496960	Beautiful idea, really. You have also another company investing into production of ammunition for such howitzers in Ukraine, also beautifully there.
496960	515960	But who is going to protect this factory where this ammunition is going to be manufactured? Who is going to protect the factory where the Bohdanas are going to be manufactured? And who is going to protect the power supply network, which is necessary in order to manufacture this stuff?
516960	525960	For this, you need air defenses, and you are getting too little air defense systems from the West and even less surface to air missiles from the West.
526960	537960	And nobody is going to invest, obviously, so far into, for example, Ukrainian companies like Luch and Artyom, launching production of Ukrainian designed surface to air missiles.
538960	546960	So this means, okay, you build something and then it's going to be destroyed by the Russians because you cannot protect it.
549960	562960	Is that making sense to you? It is not making sense to me. And what we have actually here right now, or meanwhile, Ukraine is another typical example of Western warfare of the last 30, 40 years.
563960	573960	The West can lose another war. We can afford that. It has lost Iraq. It has lost Afghanistan. No problem. We can afford to lose Ukraine as well. Also, no problem.
574960	588960	We have all the time of the world. We are more concerned about the next vacation, new car, our internet connection, watching Netflix in the evening, football, whatever else, having fun.
592960	598960	Everything is fine for us. But Ukraine, if you lose the war, there's no Ukraine left anymore.
599960	609960	And nobody here in the West is understanding this situation. And nobody is taking corresponding measures. You get lots of promises. Ukraine is getting lots of promises.
610960	622960	But in the end effect, nothing is happening. So you have a situation where the Western point of view and the Ukrainian point of view are at entirely different levels.
623960	633960	Ukrainian point of view is somewhere up here. The Western, oh, who cares? And who cares if West loses again in Ukraine? Nobody cares. Because we can afford that.
634960	644960	And nobody in Ukraine right now is taking care or sufficient care to make this obvious in the West, firstly and secondly, to say, okay, thank you very much.
645960	661960	You do not want to help seriously in serious fashion. You do not want to help us to defeat Russia. Whatever are the reasons, your fantasies about modeling the outcome and saving Russia from falling apart and saving Putin from losing face or whatever else.
661960	677960	Okay, fine. Thank you. Then just finance this and that. Thank you very much. And that's all we need. Because this is the only way forward. Ukraine must make itself as much as possible independent from any kind of Western political or military influence.
677960	692960	But at the same time develop its own defense sector, the industry, so so well and protect it so well that it can actually manufacture, develop and produce, put to the field.
692960	708960	Enough heavy armament, enough ammunition for its own needs and defeat Russia. You have no other way out of this situation. But right now, there are just conferences talking about talking, meetings, one meeting after the other.
708960	729960	You're almost answered on a bunch of our next questions. That may I turn you back for a few moments to clarify one question, which buzzers as me and Sergey, we are from Dnipro.
729960	743960	Together, do you think Russians can achieve Dnipro in a few months or next year? Dnipro, I mean, not river, but city.
743960	767960	Do the Russians, can the Russians reach Dnipro within one year or the next year? Oh, gosh, that's a good question. Let me check a map. I don't know all the distances by heart. Ukraine.
774960	776960	Dnipro.
778960	780960	Dnipro.
782960	794960	No, within one year not, not next year not. And if the, but if the things go on like, like the last, let's say one year, definitely by 2026.
795960	801960	So by saying this, you mean that the war will still continue in 2026?
801960	822960	Definitely. The way things are right now, no way this is going to stop even before 2030. Because you have, because Ukraine is not taking care to get the means to fight on its own without any kind of Western interference, which is nonsensical, nothing else.
822960	832960	And at the same time, the West is not interested in helping Ukraine fight this war in a quicker fashion and more effective fashion.
832960	840960	So you are actually going to have only the worsening of the situation because you can see this for just one example.
841960	862960	Every night, Russians are sending between, let's say 1520 and 5060 Shahid or Geran attack UAVs over the Ukrainian airspace, at least one third of this, that is, let's say, at least five and more often 2030 of this shot down by surface to air missiles, which are supplied by the West.
863960	873960	So this means an attrition of some, let's say, per week, that's something like 5060 surface to air missiles, which the West is not manufacturing.
873960	883960	The West manufactures as many missiles perhaps a month, but not per week, which means that at some point in time, you're going to run out of surface to air missiles again.
884960	899960	And the West is not going to do anything necessary to bolster, to rapidly increase the production of its surface to air missiles, because if it would be doing something, it would be doing that already now.
899960	906960	It would have announced this at least now, if not already two years ago, but it didn't do so.
907960	913960	And therefore, sooner or later, you're going to run out of surface to air missiles, probably this winter.
913960	926960	As next, the Russians are then going to disable your power supply, the remaining thermal and hydroelectric power stations, power plants.
926960	932960	And then, when you don't have the electricity, how can you manufacture?
932960	937960	You can't manufacture guns, you can't manufacture ammunition.
937960	944960	And you can't keep your civilian supply with electricity.
944960	946960	What then?
946960	954960	So unless there is a significant change in these regards alone, there is no improvement of the situation.
954960	962960	And then thirdly, there was this big announcement of Czech arms deal or Czech artillery ammunition deal.
962960	972960	They have found some source, probably Turkey, and they are going to supply how many? Two million or whatever artillery shells in addition to what is going to come to production.
972960	976960	Eventually, oh no, this is not really good.
976960	984960	That is what the western industry said to that, and because the western industry said so, the politicians said so as well.
984960	995960	And you haven't got even one million shells out of that deal by now, and I'm not going to get one million shells by the end of the year.
995960	1007960	Why? Because only a part of the countries of some 20 or something countries who have announced they are going to finance this position is ready to pay anything for the shells in question.
1007960	1014960	Why? Because they are cheaper than the shells manufactured in Europe.
1014960	1027960	I mean, again, the Ukrainian situation is up here, it's urgent, it's an emergency.
1027960	1035960	The western situation, how can we make more money out of this? That's the only thing that matters.
1035960	1049960	You're telling quite scary and sad things, maybe I will try to add some positive in our discussion. Let's talk about Ursk.
1049960	1060960	I was watching one of your interviews last month, and you were quite enthusiastic telling us this topic.
1060960	1069960	Do you still consider this operation successful or your opinion has changed?
1069960	1083960	When you monitor war in general, every war is an extension of politics by other means, precisely defined by von Klausowitz in the 19th century or earlier.
1083960	1095960	Anyway, in military sense, this was an excellent operation. Why? It drew into Russia, occupied territory, defeated lots of Russian units, destroyed even more Russian units,
1095960	1115960	and scared his entire regime and forced them to patch some sort of front line to withdraw, for example, units, especially from Northern Kharkiv, to Ursk in order to form a new front line.
1115960	1135960	The problem was, the usual, namely, there is not enough supply of ammunition, and there are not enough troops and units, and especially not enough air defenses to drive this, to exploit this penetration into Russia to sufficient depth, which would be some 100 kilometers, perhaps 150 kilometers.
1135960	1146960	Instead, Ukrainian units drew some 25-30 kilometers maximum into Russia, and with this, this operation remains incomplete.
1146960	1162960	So, at military level, it was an excellent idea and fantastic achievement, absolutely no doubt about this. At political level, it ended nowhere, for exactly the same set of reasons why all the other Ukrainian operations are ending nowhere,
1162960	1179960	which is that the President is fighting a war for scoring propaganda points in the West, appeasing and pleasing the Western politicians who are not interested in him actually anymore, who are not interested even in supporting Ukraine seriously enough.
1180960	1192960	And with this, we are ending actually this story. As long as Ukraine is running propaganda operations, it's not going to win the war. You cannot win a war with propaganda operations.
1192960	1212960	This is something for both the immoral on temporary basis, last for, as we can see, two months, and then it's over. But there is no liberation of any kind of Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine is not a step, not an inch, actually, closer to liberation of Donbas and of Crimea.
1212960	1215960	So, politically, nothing has changed.
1215960	1220960	So, what should Ukrainians do with Kursk next?
1220960	1234960	Well, hold it as long as you can, of course. You have no other solution. The troops are over there. If you withdraw the troops now from Ukraine, sorry, from Russia, from the Kursk oblast, that would be a huge shame.
1234960	1246960	So, another failure. Why have you sent your troops into Russia? Why have you lost at least 300 killed and over 1,000 wounded, so fine, two months of fighting? For what?
1246960	1256960	To withdraw now? Is that the aim of the operation? I think not. So, hold out as long as you can. The question is how long can you hold?
1256960	1271960	Right now, the Ukrainians have relatively good positions, especially in what is it, Orgoka and Shep-2-Kovka area. They are up in the hills, and the Russians attempt to approach them.
1271960	1285960	They hit them from above, they see them on time, hit them from above, and so on. So, it's relatively easy. On the other side of the same hill, they can see towards Lubimovka, so things are relatively simple.
1285960	1295960	If they lose these hills, which can happen, then it's going to become unpleasant, and the entire operation is going to end with a failure.
1296960	1317960	Tom, you mentioned mistakes of our political leaders, but you previously, while describing the Vuhledar operation, you already mentioned the mistakes of Ukrainian Genstab, military command.
1317960	1326960	Can you name the main mistakes, and probably you could suggest how those mistakes could be corrected?
1326960	1340960	The primary mistake is the over-centralization and micromanagement by the top of commanders, but the highest commander, especially Sieski.
1340960	1353960	What he is doing was okay, for example, to sort out the troubles in areas like, well, even that was too late, in Bakhmut last year or in Avidivka early this year.
1353960	1360960	There were too many elements from different units fighting in the same sector without coordination.
1360960	1372960	But now there comes the problem. Sieski has doubt his commanders that either they deliver him good news or they are in trouble.
1372960	1384960	So the problem is, if they are in trouble, they are going to get dismissed or something else, so he is going to command their own units over their shoulder instead of them, which is absolutely insane there.
1384960	1389960	You do not do such things. You have to train your commanders.
1389960	1392960	That's Russian style, as I can.
1392960	1394960	Well, more or less Russian style, yes.
1395960	1415960	The point is to train your commanders so that you, as the superior commanders in Sieski's position, can trust them to tell you what is going on, precisely the way it has happened, and not do you some kind of crazy favors through lying to you.
1415960	1422960	That is the first point. The second point is to train your commanders so that you can depend on them to do a good job.
1422960	1430960	Lots of Ukrainian commanders are still not doing a good job, and I'm talking about battalion and brigade commanders.
1430960	1443960	The command level in between of brigade commanders and Sieski should actually be responsible for controlling the job of brigade and battalion commanders, but it's not doing that at all.
1443960	1451960	It's like it's not there. I don't know why the officers in question actually paid, except perhaps from time to time to report.
1452960	1459960	Something nice to Sieski while they should, excuse me?
1463960	1469960	Excuse me, my cat would like to take part in this interview.
1469960	1477960	Where did I stop? Yes. You have groups of forces, and they should be doing the job which Sieski is currently doing.
1477960	1482960	My Sieski job should be to inspect and check that everything is working.
1482960	1497960	And finally, you have Genstaff, which is serving Sieski as a commander, instead of writing a new doctrine of the armed forces based on 10 years of bloody experience of the Ukrainian armed forces.
1497960	1507960	So that all the new commanders in the future, whether tomorrow or in two years from now, are instantly taught all of these experiences.
1507960	1517960	But it's not doing that. It's serving Sieski's purposes, which is centralized command and super control of everything and everybody.
1517960	1526960	And what a surprise amid all of this actually chaos, centralized chaos, it's not working. It can't work.
1526960	1530960	And it is never going to work the way it is organized right now.
1530960	1539960	It didn't work when it was decentralized under Zaluzhnyi and it's not going to work when it's over centralized under Sieski.
1540960	1555960	Apparently, in Ukrainian armed forces, you simply can't find some middle way to delegating, to teaching your subordinates to do their job, to trusting them, and so on.
1555960	1565960	This is something that is obviously sort of impossible to do. I don't know how to describe it.
1565960	1571960	And therefore, again, you have this superior commander who is controlling and commanding everybody.
1571960	1582960	And then you also have a president who is fighting a propaganda war instead of taking care to listen to advice of his military commanders,
1582960	1587960	who cannot even advise him properly because they're not listening to advice from their subordinates.
1587960	1591960	Then you have, as I said, you have a bardak, excuse me, for his passion.
1591960	1597960	And this is what you have in Ukraine right now.
1597960	1602960	I mentioned also general staff and the necessity to write a new doctrine of armed forces.
1602960	1614960	This doctrine should also teach the commanders that after every single operation, they have to sit down with their subordinates and discuss what went wrong and what was done well.
1614960	1623960	This is not done. You have something like 60 brigades in Ukrainian armed forces, and perhaps three are doing this right now.
1623960	1631960	The 47th, the 3rd, and the 4th National Guard. Perhaps the 12th National Guard as of brigade as well.
1631960	1639960	So you have less than 5% of the force is doing debriefs after operations. This is a catastrophe.
1639960	1648960	This means that all the lessons learned and paid in blood every single day are lost because nobody is learning from them.
1648960	1652960	We have seen this also in the Air Force, in the Air Defense Force.
1652960	1663960	Oh, everything is fine. We are shooting down Shahids, we are shooting down Kinshaws, we are shooting down Zyrkons, we are shooting down the Mars people and Jupiter people as well.
1663960	1676960	And then 12, at least 12 Russian cruise missiles fly through that super turbo air defense system and hit a hospital in downtown of Kiev in July.
1676960	1689960	And what is the Air Force reporting? It was just 12 missiles and we have shot down all of them, including those you can see on the videos coming down and hitting the hospital and killing women and children.
1689960	1701960	The same also with F-16, which was shot down by our own forces. How long is it now? One month? We are going to investigate. One month later?
1701960	1704960	Oh, who we? We should investigate this or what?
1704960	1707960	Excuse me, Tom, let's leave F-16.
1707960	1720960	Just a second, it came so far that the Americans do not trust themselves anymore to ask what has happened to that F-16 because they know then there is going to be no reply.
1720960	1721960	Sorry.
1721960	1728960	I wanted to say that let's leave F-16 for a bit later, we have a separate part for them.
1728960	1743960	Our last question in this section, we already told you that lots of our audience is located in the southern Ukraine in Kherson.
1743960	1753960	What's your predictions for Kherson and Kherson region for this fall and the next year?
1753960	1758960	My predictions, I said I'm not making predictions, I'm making post-assessments.
1758960	1761960	Let's say estimate.
1761960	1769960	Okay, okay, okay, estimate. Just a second, I'm powering up a map of the battlefield.
1769960	1789960	What you can expect next is that the Russians are going to attack from Wukhle, the directions towards what is the place first in the direction of Bahatia and Constantinople in order to, because there is nothing in between,
1789960	1795960	there is just open terrain, there are no hills, no forests, just open fields.
1795960	1810960	So they have something like 30 kilometers up to there and this is where they are going to close this corner with something like a dozen of Ukrainian brigades in between of Wukhle and southern side of the battlefield at Pokrovsk.
1810960	1830960	In Pokrovsk itself, you have to expect them to drive around such fortifications still left in front of the town like Selidove, for example, that's what they are already doing, they are trying to surround Selidove by an advance from southern side and then from the northern side as well,
1830960	1849960	because the 15th Karadag is doing a very good job with defending Selidove, so they know they cannot take the town without surrounding it first and those forcing the 15th Brigade, National Guard Brigade to withdraw from there in order to avoid that encirclement.
1849960	1865960	So once they do that, they are going to go up to Lisik and Chefchenko and search for a way to start surrounding Pokrovsk as well, that is Pokrovsk.
1866960	1880960	The rest of that operation, I mean, once they are in Pokrovsk, well, then I'm not sure what exactly they're going to do, but they're probably going to try to finish off Toretsk in between.
1880960	1891960	Toretsk is going to take them another two or three months probably to complete, but not much longer, so we can expect that Toretsk is going to fall by the end of this year.
1891960	1909960	Pokrovsk, I would say by March, reaching Pavlovgrad might become their next objective, but that is going to take them another year, so sometimes in summer, autumn next year, they might get all the way to Pavlovgrad.
1910960	1915960	What else do we have in between? Up-to-front line?
1915960	1920960	Excuse me, May I ask you to move south and to Kerson?
1920960	1933960	To remain in the south. Well, basically, they need not attacking in the south, they need not attacking Southern Zaporozhia because everything is doing along their ideas in the east.
1933960	1946960	So why attacking where they are not going to get to as we have seen this summer in Robotinia area, for example, in what is that?
1946960	1956960	Excuse me, just a check to map. South of Velikonovo, Silka, in Urogyne, for example, okay, they have captured Urogyne, but they cannot hold it.
1956960	1966960	Why wasting their resources by deploying them somewhere else if they are successful in the east? And they are successful in the east.
1966960	1973960	So can I conclude that the situation for Kerson will remain the same for the next year?
1973960	1982960	For the next year and a half, as long as not something substantial happens in Kiev, for example.
1982960	1988960	Thank you, Tom. Let's move to the second chapter, which is called Air War.
1988960	1998960	And the first question will be about Russian Cubs, guided bombs.
1998960	2009960	There are reports that Russia has increased the range of its Cubs from 30 kilometers to up to even 80 kilometers.
2009960	2014960	And the question is how much further can this range be increased?
2014960	2022960	Okay, first start. Russia didn't increase the range. The range was 60 to 70 kilometers already last year.
2022960	2030960	This is simply physics. And this physics comes from the weight of the weapon combined with the speed of the aircraft carrying it.
2030960	2038960	At the time it's released, plus the attitude of the aircraft at the time it's released the bomb.
2038960	2050960	So what happens, SO-34 comes in at an altitude between 9,000 and 12,000 meters at a high subsonic speed.
2050960	2057960	Which means something like 1,100 kilometers per hour.
2057960	2063960	So then it enters a shallow claim and it flies like this and releases the bomb.
2063960	2077960	The bombs drop from the aircraft, open their wings and then they glide over 60 to 70 kilometers in a parabolic trajectory until hitting the ground.
2077960	2085960	So the point is now the following. Depending on the sector of the front line where they deploy such bombs,
2085960	2093960	in some cases Russians are free to fly their SO-34s all the way over the Ukrainian positions.
2093960	2098960	For example, in Wuchleda area the last two weeks they were free to fly over Wuchleda.
2098960	2107960	Because the glorious general staff of Ukrainian armed forces didn't take care to deploy at least proper air defenses of that place.
2107960	2114960	Therefore, they could reach 70 kilometers behind Wuchleda.
2114960	2123960	But in other sectors, for example Kursk, they can't.
2123960	2136960	In Kursk the Ukrainian air defenses are strong enough that the Russians have to release their bombs from 70 kilometers away from, let's say, 50 kilometers behind their front line.
2136960	2142960	To reach a target only 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian front line, 10 to 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian front line.
2142960	2148960	And then it appears to plenty of people that the range is shorter than just 30 kilometers.
2148960	2155960	In other cases, the Russians do not need to hit something that is further away than 30 kilometers.
2155960	2159960	So they are releasing their bombs and they are striking targets just 30 kilometers away.
2159960	2164960	Because the target is simply closer and less well protected.
2164960	2169960	So, correspondingly, the range was always 60 to 70 kilometers.
2169960	2175960	And now it might be increased to around 100 kilometers with help of rocket boosters.
2175960	2182960	That means there is a rocket engine, rocket motor, sorry, installed on the rear, at the rear of the UMPK.
2182960	2190960	And this is then powering the bomb and instead of glide bomb it's becoming a guided missile de facto.
2190960	2193960	So that is the answer to your question.
2193960	2196960	That's clear, Tom.
2196960	2210960	Is it true that Russians already developed not far-flying Cubs but also more powerful Cubs?
2210960	2214960	I mean that more heavier ones.
2214960	2226960	For example, everyone knows about Cup 500 but some people already say about Cup 900 or something like that.
2226960	2229960	Okay, let me clarify this.
2229960	2234960	In the Soviet and therefore Russian Air Force you have specific calibers of bombs.
2234960	2243960	250 kilogram, 500 kilogram, 1,500 kilogram, 3,000, 5,000 and 9,000 kilogram bombs.
2243960	2245960	Okay, these are the biggest bombs.
2245960	2252960	A FAB, Fugas, an aviation bomb, 5,000, 9,000 was the biggest one.
2252960	2259960	And this 9,000 means it is 9,000 kilogram heavy or somewhere like that.
2259960	2270960	So correspondingly, for 9,000 kilogram bomb you need a bomb which can carry a bomb weighting 9 tons.
2270960	2272960	That is the first point.
2272960	2280960	The second point is in order to make a glide bomb out of such a bomb you need very big wings, big wing surface.
2280960	2284960	And the bigger the wing surface, the further it's flying.
2284960	2292960	Which in turn means you need the bomb itself is getting ever grow bigger and bigger.
2292960	2301960	Correspondingly, there is a big problem already with the bomb in caliber of 3,000 kilogram of 3 tons.
2302960	2311960	The construction, this UMP key construction, this module which is installed on top of the bomb is splitting wings.
2311960	2313960	So it becomes a glide bomb.
2313960	2318960	It's so big and so heavy that the bomb is weighting something like 4 tons.
2318960	2323960	That means that a single SO-34 can only carry one at once.
2323960	2326960	Also because of its sheer size.
2327960	2330960	It is not only the size, it is the weight as well.
2330960	2335960	Because you have to consider you put a 4,000 kilogram bomb under an aircraft.
2335960	2347960	And to connect it to the aircraft you need a hard point, which is we call this pylon in English, which can carry 4,000 kilogram.
2349960	2353960	And this pylon weights another 1,000 kilogram.
2353960	2358960	So now you have 4,000 kilogram of a bomb, 1,000 kilogram of the pylon.
2358960	2363960	And then you put that on the aircraft, on the SO-34, in between the engines.
2363960	2368960	And in this way you have put 4,000 kilogram on the aircraft.
2368960	2374960	SO-34 could theoretically carry 8,000 kilogram of bombs, but then it's going to fly for the next 200 kilometers.
2374960	2383960	But because of the threat of Russian bases, they have moved the SO-34s away from bases close to Ukraine.
2383960	2388960	Therefore they have to fly very far away, from very far away, from the warground in similar places.
2388960	2392960	And therefore they carry only one such bomb at once.
2392960	2394960	So that is theory. Why?
2394960	2402960	Because so far all I've seen, the biggest I've seen as deployed was 1,500 kilogram.
2403960	2406960	You are talking only about Russians or?
2406960	2408960	Russians, Russians, just Russians.
2410960	2412960	1,500 kilogram.
2412960	2416960	It could be that they have dropped one or two 3,000...
2416960	2421960	There are prototypes of 3,000 kilogram heavy UMPK or carb bomb, if you like it.
2421960	2431960	It could be they have deployed two or three of this, but I haven't seen any clear evidence, any definite evidence that there is such a weapon in serious production in Russia.
2432960	2435960	At least not its UMPK module.
2435960	2442960	There are 3,000 kilogram bombs in Russian arsenals and they are in production as well.
2442960	2449960	But there are no UMPK modules which can be installed on such bombs and manufactured in serious.
2449960	2458960	So most of the times they are actually dropping bombs, UMPK bombs or carb bombs, if you like, of 250 kilogram and 500 kilogram.
2458960	2463960	From time to time they are dropping those of 1,500 kilogram.
2463960	2469960	But 3,000 kilogram, I haven't seen clear evidence for any so far.
2469960	2473960	Even somewhere throughout the world, not only in Ukraine?
2476960	2480960	When we are talking about around the world...
2480960	2491960	Yes, the question is, are there any examples of applying such huge stuff, at least somewhere?
2491960	2494960	Maybe on the Middle East or somewhere else?
2494960	2496960	Okay, I see now what you mean.
2496960	2506960	Here we have to distinguish between bombs designed and manufactured, originally manufactured in Soviet Union and nowadays in Russia, and between western bombs.
2506960	2511960	Because western bombs are made of parts which should assemble together as necessary.
2511960	2515960	They are very flexible, they are modular, but they are construction.
2515960	2520960	On Soviet dash Russian bombs, everything is welded together.
2520960	2529960	That's it, bomb is delivered to the air base as it was manufactured, as it was put together already in the factory.
2529960	2531960	You can't change anything about it.
2531960	2547960	So the fundamental question, or the fundamental issue while developing the carb or the UMP key, was how to make a module which you can put on such a bomb which is already ready for use.
2547960	2554960	And this means that every different caliber of bomb needs a different UMP key module.
2554960	2563960	And this module must be ever bigger and bigger because it needs ever bigger wings, so that it can reach these 60 to 70 kilometers.
2563960	2570960	Correspondingly, nobody tried to do anything of this kind outside of Russia.
2570960	2575960	At least not with bombs bigger than 250 kilograms.
2575960	2587960	Most Koreans have a similar system, like UMP key, which is useful for bombs caliber 250, perhaps 500 kilograms.
2587960	2593960	And I've seen them in use by Sudanese Air Force over Yemen, for example.
2593960	2598960	Gosh, this is also 7 years ago or something like that.
2598960	2603960	So this is all I have seen in regards to Soviet dash Russian bombs.
2603960	2614960	Then it comes to western bombs. The situation is entirely different because western bombs are modular and you can put the same kit, so-called kit, on different caliber of bombs.
2614960	2623960	You have bombs caliber 125 kilograms, 250, 500, and 1000, actually not 907, but let's say 1000 kilograms.
2623960	2633960	So you put the same guidance kit and the same set of wings on different caliber of bombs.
2633960	2651960	You can also use specialized casings or bomb bodies, like BLU-109, this is this bunker-buster bomb of 1000 kilogram caliber, or 2000 pounds, as we have seen when Israel assassinated Nasrallah.
2651960	2662960	This is a specially hardened casing, which makes sure that bomb penetrates, you know, goes down to the ground, 20, 30 meters to the ground before detonating.
2662960	2677960	But the guidance system and the wings system for this bomb is still the same like on any general bomb, caliber 250 kilometers, because these bodies are all very flexible and modular.
2677960	2694960	So this is the difference. However, there are no heavier, at least not in widespread tactical service, no heavier air released bombs in western service or of western origin than 1000 kilogram.
2694960	2708960	There is one type, this massive penetrator, whatever, 10,000 kilogram bomb in the United States, but this is carried only by B-2 bombers, and that's it, not a tactical aircraft can deploy it.
2708960	2715960	So the heaviest bombs of this caliber are around 1000 kilograms in the west.
2715960	2724960	Tom, what about Ukraine? Can Ukraine, for example, use our favorite F-16s to apply such stuff?
2724960	2730960	Yes, of course. You could put two 1000 kilogram bombs on F-16.
2730960	2738960	What do you think? Is Ukrainian command going to use it?
2738960	2749960	Yes, you have already underdeveloped such a weapon. I'm just not sure if it is caliber 1000 kilogram, but you certainly have such underdeveloped a weapon of 500 kilogram.
2749960	2767960	That's very interesting. So let's stay on our favorite topic. Tom, how could you, what's your opinion of the using of western aircraft in Ukraine?
2767960	2778960	In order to use western aircraft in Ukraine, you have to change the entire system, how aviation is operating in Ukraine, and this is happening very, very slowly.
2778960	2799960	It took the delivery of F-16s to Ukraine for the top civilian authority in Ukraine, I forgot the name, sorry now, to write a new set of regulations for pilots, for ground personnel, for ground control and so on, and for radar systems and so on.
2799960	2806960	So before that, you still had the same system like in the Soviet Union.
2806960	2820960	So now you have to, in order to use, the next step in using western aircraft is to teach your troops, your ground crews and your pilots to speak English.
2820960	2841960	Which is the next hurdle because despite all the talk about we are going to buy western aircraft, whether a sub-grip pen or F-16s or whatever else, of the last, let's say, 10 years or something like that, nobody in the air force took care to organize English language courses for pilots and for ground personnel.
2841960	2853960	Which means that every time Ukraine sends pilots and ground personnel for training in the west, they first have to spend 6 months, at least, learning English.
2854960	2863960	So now once they learn English, only then can they start training actual flying training or aircraft.
2863960	2879960	Before they start this actual training, flight training on aircraft, they have to learn the basic principles, procedures of flying in the west, which are fundamentally different than those in the former Soviet Union.
2879960	2895960	So even then, actually, they still do not instantly start training on aircraft, but they first learn the procedures and terminology in order to start learning flying aircraft or maintaining aircraft or arming them, refueling them and so on and so on.
2895960	2910960	So you have, every time a new group of Ukrainians is sent to west to learn flying F-16s or whatever else, it takes at least a year to get them so far that they start actually learning to fly the aircraft.
2911960	2924960	Correspondingly, from this point of view, you can instantly calculate how long is it going to take for an entire Ukrainian air force to convert to, let's say, F-16s.
2924960	2926960	This is just F-16s.
2926960	2929960	Another part is going to convert to Gripens.
2929960	2936960	At least a unit is going to fly this sub-AVAC aircraft and similar stuff.
2937960	2942960	So this is a process that is going to take years.
2946960	2957960	Can we say that today is too early to make conclusions about applying F-16s and other aircraft in Ukraine?
2957960	2960960	It's not too early. It's not too early. Don't worry.
2960960	2975960	Let's say, even if the Dutch would junk all of their 40 or whatever F-16s that are still around up on Ukraine tomorrow in the morning, it would still take you one to two years to train enough personnel to fly all of them.
2975960	2977960	You do not have enough people.
2977960	2979960	Someone is already flying.
2979960	2981960	Just flying.
2981960	2982960	Over Ukraine.
2982960	2985960	You don't have enough pilots. You don't have enough ground personnel.
2985960	2989960	You don't have the support infrastructure. You don't have the spares.
2989960	2995960	You don't have maintenance facilities in Ukraine. You don't have it. It's simply not there.
2995960	3007960	So you mean that those aircraft which already fly above Ukraine, they do not conduct any military mission?
3007960	3008960	Oh, no. I do not say that.
3008960	3009960	What do they do?
3009960	3018960	There are five F-16s in Ukraine. This is the group that was delivered, what is it, two months ago, and they are flying air combat sorties.
3018960	3023960	Air defense sorties. I'm not dispute about this.
3023960	3038960	But increasing this number to, let's say, 30 or something, to something meaningful, you know, to a number that is making sense or having its effect upon developments on the battlefield.
3038960	3040960	It's going to take its time.
3040960	3043960	Okay. That's clear.
3043960	3054960	We also had a question that is being asked throughout Ukraine for about three years.
3054960	3063960	Why don't we still have our own iron dome above Ukraine?
3063960	3067960	What's about Ukrainian air defense?
3067960	3073960	Yeah. Where should I start?
3073960	3079960	Well, I mean, you are Ukrainian. You know it better than me. You grew up in Ukraine, if nothing else. I've never been to Ukraine.
3079960	3091960	The first problem is that from the independence in 1991, 1992, until 2014, nobody cared about Ukrainian armed forces.
3091960	3095960	So they were constantly decreasing, decreasing, decreasing, decreasing, downsizing, downsizing.
3095960	3103960	Units were constantly disbanded. Air bases were closed. Nobody needed armed forces.
3103960	3107960	There was peace everywhere. Everything was so beautiful.
3107960	3114960	And well, it's a matter of fact that Ukrainian economy wasn't particularly good.
3114960	3119960	So you had a situation where there was no money for armed forces either.
3119960	3128960	And therefore, although you had excellent companies which could design a manufacturing weaponry, nobody was buying this weaponry.
3128960	3134960	And so these companies, in some cases, ended working for the Russians, and not only a few of them.
3134960	3145960	So when the Russians needed some kind of tactical-guided weapons, air-to-air missiles and so on, these were made, or at least major parts of them,
3145960	3156960	major assemblies of them were made in Ukraine. And then the Russians would either use these at home or sell them abroad, export them to whatever customers.
3156960	3164960	So now the 2014 came, and there are lots of announcements and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and nothing happened.
3164960	3174960	Well, the most that has happened was to overhaul MiG-29s and S-25s and S-24s, very few S-24s, S-27s.
3174960	3184960	So they were overhauled. That means that they were taken apart, cleaned, refurbished, most important pieces were replaced.
3184960	3192960	Then everything was assembled, painted anew, and they received a new radio, they received new weapons management systems.
3192960	3199960	MiG-29s have even received this new computer, which is improving the performance of their radar. Beautiful.
3199960	3207960	And that's it. Nobody came to the idea, obviously, to finance the installation of development research and installation of,
3207960	3215960	or actually serious production and installation of new air-to-air missiles on MiG-29s or S-27s.
3215960	3226960	So this is the first point. The second point is, in order to have such weaponry, whether air-to-air missiles or surface-to-air missiles,
3226960	3231960	you should have had somebody who would manufacture them.
3231960	3247960	Basically, you had several design bureaus like Luch, for example, who have designs of new air-to-air missile and its surface-launched version,
3247960	3256960	with a range of something like 100 kilometers, which is something which your armed forces would need urgently right now,
3256960	3262960	and then not in a few examples, but in thousands. But it's not there. Why?
3262960	3271960	Well, because, obviously, somebody there is convinced that these are old companies, that they are too complex and they're wasting too much money
3271960	3277960	and doing nothing and they're useful and whatever else, therefore nothing is done.
3277960	3287960	And now, even if Luch would start, or actually give Artyom the production to launch this production, the serious production of this new weaponry,
3287960	3297960	it would take at least a year to introduce it to service. On the other side, meanwhile, Artyom was heavily hit several times by the Russians this summer,
3297960	3302960	so I don't even know how much of its underground facilities are still actually operational.
3302960	3312960	So why didn't this happen? Because nobody in Kiev had the far side enough to say, okay, guys, listen, we have to build up,
3312960	3321960	we have to invest into our defense sector, we have to reform it on time and then let it start manufacturing new weaponry on time.
3321960	3332960	So nothing happened in these regards, actually, even as of, was it Autumn 2022, perhaps in Autumn the last year.
3332960	3340960	And therefore, you do not have serious production, you do not have new ballistic missiles, you do not have air-to-air missiles,
3340960	3350960	you do not have surface-to-air missiles, although your companies have ready to use designs for them and they could put them into production.
3350960	3357960	The next point is also that there is always this petty bickering about who is going to get the money for this.
3357960	3368960	You have advisors to the government who are complaining that Artyom and Luch, they are old and this is too complex and let's not give them money.
3368960	3377960	Let's get this stuff from the West, which is nonsensical. It would have been better to pay Artyom already back in 2022
3377960	3381960	to start manufacturing these new air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles.
3381960	3388960	However, the government back then was convinced now this war is going to end, whatever, in the 6 months, 12 months or something.
3388960	3392960	Therefore, you did not launch production on time.
3392960	3401960	Even the Neptune anti-ship missile, which is meanwhile also developed as a cruise missile, was available on in prototype form.
3402960	3418960	Some 12 or 15 examples around in February 2022 and this first successful deployment against Russian guided missile cruiser Moskva was actually something like an ultimate test of the weapon.
3418960	3427960	Before that, there was no operational unit in the Ukrainian Armed Forces operating Neptune's.
3427960	3433960	And ever since, how many are manufactured? 15 perhaps a year.
3433960	3446960	15 a year, where you could need actually, let's say at least 500 of them and probably then develop them into land attack versions, which could be launched from Asia 24.
3446960	3455960	So you don't need to beg Germans, British, French and the Americans for more storm shadows and similar stuff.
3455960	3458960	You could have had all of this already years ago.
3458960	3465960	Your government just failed to reorganize the defense sector to finance it properly to launch the production.
3465960	3472960	Right now, your defense sector is working with 40 to 60% of its capacity.
3472960	3482960	Which means actually that people are sitting there and working something like, let's say, 4 to 5 hours a day instead of 8 hours a day in 3 shifts.
3482960	3493960	This is insane. You're facing a war of extermination and your defense sector is sitting there and waiting for better times.
3493960	3502960	Because there's nobody in Kiev capable of reorganizing the financing of the sector and then the management of the sector itself.
3502960	3504960	Nothing is happening.
3504960	3515960	There are always big announcements, but until somebody from the West comes in, pays a lot of money probably somewhere and then invests a lot of money into one or the other factory, nothing happens.
3515960	3521960	And that is why you don't have modern air-to-air missiles for your suhuis and for your mix.
3521960	3524960	And why you don't have enough surface-to-air missiles.
3524960	3536960	And why, therefore, the entire production and the entire defense sector, its future functionality is under a big question mark.
3536960	3542960	Thank you, Tom, for such comprehensive explanation of our situation.
3542960	3545960	A few questions left.
3545960	3552960	The last one from this section is about Russian and Iranian trade.
3552960	3562960	Everyone in Ukraine knows that Russia buys Shahads and ballistic missiles and everything else from Iran.
3562960	3570960	From time to time, you're expressing your doubts about the actual amount of such military trade.
3570960	3573960	Could you please share with us your thoughts?
3573960	3576960	There is no alliance between Russia and Iran.
3576960	3584960	There's a relation between a customer and seller.
3584960	3590960	And there's lots of rivalry and lots of mistrust, especially from Iranians.
3590960	3595960	So all these stories about ballistic missiles, where are they?
3596960	3600960	I haven't seen any kind of Iranian ballistic missiles in Russia yet.
3600960	3603960	Because we already destroyed all of them.
3603960	3604960	Of course.
3604960	3606960	A few weeks ago.
3606960	3612960	You have even destroyed the secret depots where they were stored, you know?
3612960	3613960	Okay, seriously now.
3613960	3618960	There are no ballistic missiles in Iran, ballistic missiles in Russia.
3618960	3622960	Except they have delivered them the last five days, say.
3622960	3624960	It's not going to happen.
3624960	3628960	And for a simple reason that the Iranians do not trust the Russians.
3628960	3632960	I mean, study a little bit the history of Russia and Iran and their rivalry.
3632960	3639960	And you're going to see that they hate each other almost like Ukrainians and Russians are hating each other nowadays.
3639960	3650960	So, and then check the history of the last 20, 30 years and all the repeated attempts of Tehran to buy major weapons systems from Russia.
3650960	3660960	And every single one, almost every single one was screwed up, excuse me, for his passion in one way or the other by the Russians.
3660960	3669960	And then you have the situation in the Caspian Sea, where the Iranians would like to bring in their ships for exploration of gas and oil.
3669960	3676960	They know that it is there at the bottom of the sea, but they cannot bring their ships to explore it, to find it.
3676960	3683960	And to start drilling for it and exploiting it because the Russians wouldn't let them do so.
3683960	3688960	You cannot bring such a ship. These are big ships. They are very wide. They're very heavy.
3688960	3695960	And you cannot, the Iranians cannot build them on their own, on the Caspian, on their coast of the Caspian Sea.
3695960	3702960	So they would have to bring them via the river and channel systems of Russia from the Black Sea and so on.
3702960	3704960	You know this better than me.
3704960	3708960	So the Russians wouldn't let them. They wouldn't let them.
3708960	3711960	So this is the problem number one for the Iranians.
3711960	3723960	Problem number two, I said, every single major arms deal between Moscow and Tehran in the last 30 years, was messed up by the Russians.
3723960	3731960	There would be an agreement, a contract was signed, Iranians would pay 50% advance and nothing happened.
3731960	3738960	All the Russia, or if something happened, the Russians would deliver something entirely different than the Iranians have ordered.
3738960	3745960	That means, for example, the Iranians have ordered S-300 air defense systems, long-range air defense systems.
3745960	3751960	Russians delivered Tor, short-range air defense systems and such things.
3751960	3760960	And in some cases, for example, the Iranians, in one case, they went to Moscow and said, look, we want MiG-31s.
3760960	3768960	Here is one billion for them, right on the table, deliver them in one or two years whenever.
3768960	3774960	The Russians pocketed money and did nothing.
3774960	3785960	And then two years later, after lots of complaints from Tehran, the Russians delivered yet more tours and books and such things instead.
3785960	3791960	So why should Iranians trust them? They have no reason.
3791960	3798960	Shahid's UAVs, attack UAVs, was an exception from the rule. Why?
3798960	3807960	Because the Russians were so stupid to pay for something that is worth, perhaps, $5,000 to pay $200,000 per single Shahid.
3807960	3809960	Your own hackers have found this out.
3809960	3815960	So it was a brilliant opportunity, not in special, you know, no high technology from China, actually.
3815960	3819960	Okay, let them have it. We are cashing millions from this.
3819960	3822960	And that is why Russians have such weaponry.
3822960	3828960	But other Iranian weaponry, I haven't seen anything of that kind in Russia.
3828960	3836960	I've seen mortars and mortar shells of Iranian origins in Ukraine, but not in Russia.
3836960	3839960	So, that much about that.
3839960	3848960	And even if this fat, everybody's calling it ballistic missile, this is not a ballistic missile, this is an artillery rocket.
3848960	3855960	It is similar like BM-27 or BM-30, which Ukraine is also operating, BM-27, not BM-30.
3855960	3857960	And which Russia is already operating.
3857960	3866960	This is a heavy rocket, which is relatively precise and has a range of 100-120 kilometers.
3866960	3874960	Of course, if Iranians would deliver any to Russia, that would be a big problem for Ukraine, because they have a big warhead.
3874960	3884960	And if Iranians would deliver even just a few hundreds of them to Russia, Russian firepower would increase significantly.
3884960	3891960	But so far, I haven't seen an atom of evidence that any have been delivered to Russia.
3891960	3893960	And there is a good reason for this.
3893960	3898960	Because, for example, Iranian Air Force would like to acquire Su-35s.
3898960	3907960	But if the Iranians acquire Su-35s, they do not only want the aircraft, but they want also the capability to maintain this aircraft at home,
3907960	3913960	which in turn means they need the capability to manufacture spare parts for this aircraft at home.
3914960	3920960	And the Russians, this is something the Russians would deliver even to the Chinese, not to talk about Iranians.
3920960	3929960	So, as a bargain for such an eventuality, Iranians are holding back their ballistic missiles.
3929960	3935960	And now, when Iran is almost in a state of war with Israel, even more so.
3935960	3942960	They are not crazy to say, let's sell out our entire missile arsenal to Russia.
3942960	3944960	We are going to earn a few billion.
3944960	3949960	But if they sell off their ballistic missiles, they have nothing to shoot at Israel.
3951960	3958960	Therefore, all of these stories about thousands of Iranian ballistic missiles and blah, blah, blah, blah, to Russia.
3959960	3968960	And finally, after all of this, I said mistrust, bad experiences and so on.
3970960	3978960	Iranians have attempted to enter a sort of strategically alliance with Putin several times.
3978960	3981960	And he has turned them down every single time.
3981960	3987960	They have absolutely no reason to insist on some kind of alliance with him now.
3987960	3988960	Why should they?
3988960	3995960	So, even this story with alliance and whatever else, this is all lots of fantasy and at least as much hysteria.
3995960	4008960	And if nothing else, it's usually used in order to, for some, especially in the West, for some propagating some third point of issues.
4008960	4018960	Like, for example, the first time that there was a talk about the sale of F-35s to Israel, there was promptly a report that Iran is buying 100 S-27s.
4018960	4019960	I mean, which is nonsense.
4019960	4028960	Of course, Iran never bought S-27s, but because it was buying them because of fake news, Israel should get F-35s.
4028960	4029960	No problem.
4029960	4030960	This is how it works.
4031960	4032960	Thank you, Tom.
4032960	4035960	Let's hope they will not deal with each other.
4035960	4041960	Last few questions, and let's try to cover them shortly.
4041960	4048960	The first one, will Russian Federation complete the railway to Crimea this year?
4049960	4050960	Yes.
4050960	4052960	Isn't it already to Melitopol?
4054960	4055960	I'm not sure.
4055960	4056960	I'm not sure.
4056960	4062960	Do you think that this will cause huge consequences for us?
4062960	4063960	Of course.
4063960	4064960	Of course.
4065960	4067960	Railway from what is the place?
4067960	4074960	Niprov down to Melitopol, for example, that's making things massively easier for the Russians.
4074960	4076960	I do not need the Kerch Bridge anymore.
4077960	4083960	They can transport, what, 5000 kg, 5000 tons, sorry, a day to Melitopol.
4084960	4085960	It's perfect for them.
4086960	4091960	And the Ukrainians can, of course, try to hit that with my missiles and so on and so on,
4091960	4094960	but the Russians have it easier to repair a railway,
4094960	4099960	then it's much more complicated to repair a bridge instead.
4099960	4102960	So it is a perfect solution for them.
4103960	4104960	Thank you.
4104960	4111960	Regarding the bridge, what do you think, is it possible to destroy the Crimean Bridge with missiles?
4112960	4118960	With missiles alone, not really.
4119960	4126960	You can damage it temporarily, close it for a few weeks or even for two months, and that's it.
4126960	4130960	But you really need big missiles and really have to hit,
4130960	4134960	a very precise hit in a specific part of the construction.
4134960	4137960	You mean ballistic missiles, not cruise missiles?
4137960	4138960	Ballistic missiles, yes.
4138960	4139960	No, no cruise missiles.
4139960	4141960	No, no cruise missiles, okay.
4141960	4143960	I mean, it doesn't matter.
4143960	4148960	You need something like a 2000 kg warhead and this must be extremely precise
4148960	4153960	and hitting this particular part of the construction in order to drop a bridge.
4153960	4159960	It is pointless to hit the middle of the bridge because you're just going to create a gap in the road.
4159960	4160960	Nothing is going to happen.
4160960	4166960	We have seen this on so many other examples, Antonovsky Bridge, almost two years ago.
4166960	4175960	So, excuse me, right now I don't see Ukraine having an ability to drop the catch bridge.
4177960	4178960	Okay, thank you.
4178960	4180960	Tom, we have the last question.
4180960	4186960	You recently described the scenario for ending the war in the Middle East.
4186960	4190960	You yourself called it almost fantastic.
4190960	4192960	Yeah, it is fantasy, yes.
4192960	4199960	Yes, so could you please describe more or less realistic scenario for ending the war in Ukraine?
4199960	4202960	No, I can't because I have no idea how to end it.
4202960	4207960	I mean, there is so much reform necessary alone in Ukraine.
4207960	4214960	You would need to reorganize the way your government is thinking, not only to say acting.
4214960	4218960	You would need to bring your population all to one side and say,
4218960	4221960	guys, we are really in danger of extermination.
4221960	4227960	If you are sitting at home and watching TV, you are screwing up all of you, all of us.
4227960	4229960	You don't even have this psychology.
4229960	4234960	I mean, okay, you have lots of volunteers and people are really trying to help the country and so on.
4234960	4239960	But a big part of the population is just sitting there and doing nothing for Ukraine.
4240960	4248960	Then, as next, you would have to understand that you need many more women in your armed forces in your industry and so on and so on.
4248960	4252960	I cannot understand that you still have unemployed people at war.
4252960	4255960	You have unemployed people in Ukraine. How can this happen?
4255960	4262960	I said, your defense sector is idling around working at 40% to 60% of capacity.
4263960	4273960	And even if it would certainly like to work at higher capacity, but it can't because the government does not have the money for that.
4273960	4278960	And so you have serious problems, very extensive problems with you.
4278960	4282960	I have no idea how to solve all of this.
4282960	4286960	So therefore, I have no clear idea how can you solve the problem.
4286960	4297960	Ideally, you would manufacture, let's say, 500 to 1000 tanks a year and then you would manufacture a similar number of heavy infantry fighting vehicles.
4297960	4301960	That means vehicles as well armored as tanks.
4301960	4309960	You would manufacture not one million FPV drones a year, but five million of them.
4309960	4312960	You would have enough pilots and crews for all of this.
4312960	4314960	You would equip your entire armed forces.
4314960	4323960	You would have, ideally, you would have enough artillery ammunition and even more important, you would have such missiles like FAT or rockets.
4323960	4331960	Actually, sorry, artillery rockets like FAT, which means you can deliver a warhead of 100, 200, 300 kilogram over range of 100 kilometers.
4331960	4341960	Ideally, you would need something like 20, at least 20 Patriots and batteries, plus a similar number of IST and 70.
4341960	4350960	If you are empty, you don't have anything of this and I don't see you getting anything of this, but even enough to patch up your air defenses and so on and so on.
4350960	4353960	So I have no solution right now.
4353960	4365960	What you need is plenty of firepower and I mean really firepower in terms of 100, 200, 300 kilogram warheads being delivered and obliterating entire Russian units.
4365960	4368960	This is happening perhaps once a month, but this is too little.
4368960	4370960	You would need this happening every single day.
4370960	4377960	I also do not understand, I mean, how long is it now that you have got the first high mass that was in summer 2022?
4377960	4382960	So two years and you're still not manufacturing high mass at home?
4382960	4384960	I cannot understand this.
4384960	4385960	Why not?
4385960	4391960	You're all the time waiting for Americans to have mercy and send you another 30 rockets.
4391960	4392960	Aether comes.
4392960	4398960	Why is nobody manufacturing aether comes in Ukraine?
4398960	4399960	Out of mind of what?
4399960	4411960	Instead, the government has been, as far as I have heard, is letting the Americans buy agricultural surfaces, real estate.
4411960	4417960	I mean, it's not letting them buy directly, but it says okay, if some foreigner wants to buy it, let's do it.
4417960	4420960	And Ukrainians don't have the money to do so, so foreigners are buying it.
4420960	4425960	And the first foreigners who are doing it in the soil are the Americans.
4426960	4429960	So you're going to end as what?
4429960	4434960	A heavily indebted, lucky home territory?
4434960	4436960	I don't know where is this heading.
4436960	4439960	I have no solution for this problem, excuse me.
4439960	4444960	I mean, Middle East is perfect in comparison.
4444960	4445960	Thank you, Tom.
4445960	4451960	I hope our audience will make the appropriate conclusions from your words.
4451960	4460960	And at the end, I would just mention that we're not publishing all of Tom's texts.
4460960	4468960	That's, I'm talking to our audience, all of Tom's texts for different reasons.
4468960	4483960	But if you are looking for an interesting, competent overview of the events in the Middle East,
4483960	4489960	I would probably suggest you to take a look at Tom's blog,
4489960	4497960	because I believe that a person who spent almost 40 years studying this region
4497960	4507960	probably knows a bit more comparing to those experts you are watching on our TV.
4507960	4510960	So thank you so much, Tom.
4510960	4521960	It was a big pleasure to talk to you and they hope we will have another interview a bit later.
4521960	4524960	Thank you very much for inviting me as well.
4524960	4532960	And please keep yourself safe and do the best for your country and for all of you.
4532960	4533960	Thank you, Tom.
4533960	4535960	Goodbye, everyone.
4535960	4536960	Stay safe.
4536960	4537960	Goodbye.
