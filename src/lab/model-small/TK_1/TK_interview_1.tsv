0	10640	Great, greetings to everyone who is watching us, hope you all are safe.
10640	16640	My name is Konstantin Shabalev, and today we together with my colleague, media expert
16640	20920	Sergey Chernevsky are happy to introduce our guest.
20920	26960	It's Tom Cooper, military historian, writer and analyst from Austria.
26960	35960	Tom himself has Austria's Mozart, not kangaroo, but I hope that our audience is educated enough not to confuse.
35960	38960	Hello, Tom, how are you?
38960	42960	Hello, thank you, fine, nice to be with you today.
42960	52960	Great, so among other things, Tom is known in Ukraine as an author of regular updates on the Russian-Ukrainian war.
52960	62960	And almost six months have passed since our first interview, a lot of things changed, and we'd like to discuss them with Tom.
62960	76960	We tried to divide our conversation in several sections, like Tom does in his updates, so the first chapter of our talk is called the Ground War.
76960	88960	And the first question is the following, Tom, we are forced to start with a sad topic earlier this week, Ukraine with Derov from Vuhledar.
88960	101960	And you were describing this process almost live, and now we'd like to know your opinion on what consequences will it cause for Ukraine.
101960	124960	Vuhledar, it's a topic, very frustrating topic because this was such a left down of a great unit that was fighting courageously and with huge skill for two years in that place alone,
124960	147960	we talked about the Battle of Moschun, north-west of Kiev, back in March 2022, and was now left down by top political leadership in Ukraine, by the general staff of Ukrainian armed forces, like really, it's in a most shameful way.
147960	159960	And what should I tell you, I mean, it wasn't really an orderly withdrawal, everybody is calling withdrawal in Ukraine.
159960	180960	Actually, the last two or three days, the defenses of the 72nd collapsed, the Russians attacked from three sides, draw in, captured, I don't know how many troops killed, I don't know how many troops, including plenty of wounded troops,
180960	197960	the soldiers of the 72nd have demanded a withdrawal on time, there was no reaction from Kiev at all, as usually, I mean, it is a shameful episode in the history of Ukraine and nothing else.
197960	212960	It is such a meanwhile typical failure of the political and military leadership in the country that I simply, I cannot understand that something of this kind is happening.
212960	240960	And now, what is after, what now, well, what is left of the 72nd Brigade, perhaps 1000 troops who are tired, exhausted, demoralized, who is going to replace them, who is going to replace such an excellent defense position for the next 30 or 40 kilometers in western or northwestern direction, there is nothing.
241960	258960	So when you ask me what is going to happen now or whatever, I'm not sure, I mean, the only thing we can actually expect is Russia, further Russian advance in western and northwestern direction, or northern direction towards Pokrovsk, that's what's going to happen.
258960	270960	And I do not see the Ukrainian armed forces having a strong position on the way to say Pokrovsk. That's the situation.
271960	292960	Okay, we'll talk about the Ukrainian command a bit later and you mentioned Pokrovsk. Our second question was about this place. Russian army continues to slowly advance towards Pokrovsk.
292960	311960	And what do you think, if they do manage to occupy it, what will be their next target? As I understand, it's some kind of point from which they can advance in different ways.
311960	340960	Pokrovsk, that is related to Vukhleda. And to the situation at the political top in Kiev and in the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. If they continue fighting this war the way they are doing this the last year or so, actually the last one and a half year, almost two years, Pokrovsk is lost already now.
340960	351960	It's pointless to fight for it almost, because it's nothing is going to happen over there, except yet more losses for Ukraine and yet more victories for Russia.
351960	375960	Well, this victory is actually laughable, but okay, who cares. Point is this, you have a president who is fighting for some kind of imaginary USAID and spending and wasting his time with some kind of peace plan which he is then traveling to the United States and presenting it there and to Biden and to Trump and so on.
375960	392960	And what peace plan? What peace plan? There is only one party in this war which can stop this war immediately. And this is Russia, this is Putin. He can stop immediately. Ukraine has no chance to do anything of that kind.
392960	407960	The United States has no chance of doing that. Germany has no chance. Whoever else has no chance. But Russia can stop it. But Russia has absolutely no reason to stop it, because everything is working straight into Putin's hands.
407960	423960	Then the next point. Expecting the Americans now to start providing sufficient support for Ukraine to win this war, to at least liberate some kind of serious portion of territory inside Ukraine is not going to happen.
424960	439960	If nobody in Ukraine has realized this by now, well, it's about the time for somebody to start realizing it finally. But this is also not happening. So you are wasting, your political leadership is wasting time for some kind of fantasies around.
439960	464960	The only thing I've seen him doing that is making sense in the last, let's say, two weeks was this conference with different manufacturers and designers of modern weaponry and trying to attract them into investing into Ukrainian sector of manufacturing defense equipment, ammunition and weaponry.
464960	486960	And this is all. And this is also too little. And going also in some kind chaotic direction, because what is happening? You have, for example, Denmark financing the production of Bohdan self-propelled howitzer in Ukraine.
486960	496960	Beautiful idea, really. You have also another company investing into production of ammunition for such howitzers in Ukraine, also beautifully there.
496960	515960	But who is going to protect this factory where this ammunition is going to be manufactured? Who is going to protect the factory where the Bohdanas are going to be manufactured? And who is going to protect the power supply network, which is necessary in order to manufacture this stuff?
516960	525960	For this, you need air defenses, and you are getting too little air defense systems from the West and even less surface to air missiles from the West.
526960	537960	And nobody is going to invest, obviously, so far into, for example, Ukrainian companies like Luch and Artyom, launching production of Ukrainian designed surface to air missiles.
538960	546960	So this means, okay, you build something and then it's going to be destroyed by the Russians because you cannot protect it.
549960	562960	Is that making sense to you? It is not making sense to me. And what we have actually here right now, or meanwhile, Ukraine is another typical example of Western warfare of the last 30, 40 years.
563960	573960	The West can lose another war. We can afford that. It has lost Iraq. It has lost Afghanistan. No problem. We can afford to lose Ukraine as well. Also, no problem.
574960	588960	We have all the time of the world. We are more concerned about the next vacation, new car, our internet connection, watching Netflix in the evening, football, whatever else, having fun.
592960	598960	Everything is fine for us. But Ukraine, if you lose the war, there's no Ukraine left anymore.
599960	609960	And nobody here in the West is understanding this situation. And nobody is taking corresponding measures. You get lots of promises. Ukraine is getting lots of promises.
610960	622960	But in the end effect, nothing is happening. So you have a situation where the Western point of view and the Ukrainian point of view are at entirely different levels.
623960	633960	Ukrainian point of view is somewhere up here. The Western, oh, who cares? And who cares if West loses again in Ukraine? Nobody cares. Because we can afford that.
634960	644960	And nobody in Ukraine right now is taking care or sufficient care to make this obvious in the West, firstly and secondly, to say, okay, thank you very much.
645960	661960	You do not want to help seriously in serious fashion. You do not want to help us to defeat Russia. Whatever are the reasons, your fantasies about modeling the outcome and saving Russia from falling apart and saving Putin from losing face or whatever else.
661960	677960	Okay, fine. Thank you. Then just finance this and that. Thank you very much. And that's all we need. Because this is the only way forward. Ukraine must make itself as much as possible independent from any kind of Western political or military influence.
677960	692960	But at the same time develop its own defense sector, the industry, so so well and protect it so well that it can actually manufacture, develop and produce, put to the field.
692960	708960	Enough heavy armament, enough ammunition for its own needs and defeat Russia. You have no other way out of this situation. But right now, there are just conferences talking about talking, meetings, one meeting after the other.
708960	729960	You're almost answered on a bunch of our next questions. That may I turn you back for a few moments to clarify one question which buzzers as me and Sergey, we are from Dnipro.
729960	743960	Together, do you think Russians can achieve Dnipro in a few months or next year? Dnipro, I mean not river, but city.
743960	767960	Do the Russians, can the Russians reach Dnipro within one year or the next year? Oh gosh, that's a good question. Let me check a map. I don't know all the distances by heart. Ukraine.
774960	776960	Dnipro.
778960	780960	Dnipro.
782960	794960	No, within one year not, not next year not. But if the things go on like the last, let's say one year, definitely by 2026.
795960	801960	So by saying this, you mean that the war will still continue in 2026?
801960	822960	Definitely. The way things are right now, no way this is going to stop even before 2030. Because Ukraine is not taking care to get the means to fight on its own without any kind of Western interference which is nonsensical, nothing else.
822960	832960	And at the same time, the West is not interested in helping Ukraine fight this war in a quicker fashion and more effective fashion.
832960	840960	So you are actually going to have only the worsening of the situation because you can see this for just one example.
841960	851960	Every night, Russians are sending between, let's say, 1520 and 5060 Shahid or Geran attack UAVs over the Ukrainian airspace.
851960	863960	At least one third of this, let's say at least five and more often 2030 of this, are shot down by surface-to-air missiles which are supplied by the West.
863960	873960	So this means an attrition of some, let's say, per week, that's something like 5060 surface-to-air missiles, which the West is not manufacturing.
873960	878960	The West manufactures as many missiles perhaps a month, but not per week.
878960	884960	Which means that at some point in time, you're going to run out of surface-to-air missiles again.
884960	894960	And the West is not going to do anything necessary to bolster, to rapidly increase the production of its surface-to-air missiles.
894960	899960	Because if it would be doing something these regards, it would be doing that already now.
899960	906960	It would have announced this at least now if not already two years ago, but it didn't do so.
906960	912960	And therefore, sooner or later, you're going to run out of surface-to-air missiles, probably this winter.
913960	926960	As next, the Russians are then going to disable your power supply, the remaining thermal and hydroelectric power stations, power plants.
926960	932960	And then, when you don't have the electricity, how can you manufacture?
932960	937960	You can't manufacture guns, you can't manufacture ammunition.
937960	944960	And you can't keep your civilian supply with electricity.
944960	946960	What then?
946960	954960	So, unless there is a significant change in these regards alone, there is no improvement of the situation.
954960	962960	And then thirdly, there was this big announcement of Czech arms deal or Czech artillery ammunition deal.
962960	972960	They have found some source, probably Turkey, and they are going to supply how many? Two million or whatever artillery shells in addition to what is going to come to production.
972960	976960	Eventually, oh no, this is not really good.
976960	979960	That is what the Western industry said to that.
979960	983960	And because the Western industry said so, the politicians said so as well.
983960	995960	And you haven't got even one million shells out of that deal by now, and they're not going to get one million shells by the end of the year.
995960	1007960	Why? Because only a part of the countries of some 20 or something countries who have announced they're going to finance this position is ready to pay anything for the shells in question.
1007960	1012960	Why? Because they are cheaper than the shells manufactured in Europe.
1014960	1026960	I mean, again, Ukrainian situation is up here, it's urgent, it's an emergency.
1026960	1034960	The Western situation, how can we make more money out of this? That's the only thing that matters.
1034960	1040960	Tom, you're telling quite scary and sad things.
1040960	1045960	Maybe I will try to add some positive in our discussion.
1045960	1048960	Let's talk about Ursk.
1048960	1060960	I was watching one of your interviews last month, and you were quite enthusiastic on this topic.
1060960	1069960	Do you still consider this operation successful or your opinion has changed?
1069960	1083960	When you monitor war in general, every war is an extension of politics by other means, precisely defined by von Klausowitz in the 19th century or earlier.
1083960	1087960	Anyway, in military sense, this was an excellent operation.
1087960	1102960	Why? It drew into Russia, occupied territory, defeated lots of Russian units, destroyed even more Russian units, scared his entire regime,
1102960	1115960	and forced them to patch some sort of front line to withdraw, for example, units, especially from Northern Kharkiv, to Ursk in order to form a new front line.
1115960	1124960	The problem was the usual, namely, there is not enough supply of ammunition and there are not enough troops and units,
1124960	1135960	and especially not enough air defenses to drive this, to exploit this penetration into Russia to sufficient depth, which would be some 100 kilometers, perhaps 150 kilometers.
1135960	1141960	Instead, Ukrainian units drew some 25-30 kilometers maximum into inside Russia.
1141960	1146960	And with this, this operation remains incomplete.
1146960	1153960	So at military level, it was an excellent idea and fantastic achievement, absolutely no doubt about this.
1153960	1162960	At political level, it ended nowhere for exactly the same set of reasons why all the other Ukrainian operations are ending nowhere,
1162960	1169960	which is that the president is fighting a war for scoring propaganda points in the West,
1169960	1179960	appeasing and pleasing the Western politicians who are not interested in him actually anymore, who are not interested even in supporting Ukraine seriously enough.
1179960	1184960	And with this, we are ending actually this story.
1184960	1189960	As long as Ukraine is running propaganda operations, it's not going to win the war.
1189960	1192960	You cannot win a war with propaganda operations.
1192960	1201960	This is something for both the immoral on temporary basis, last for, as we can see, two months, and then it's over.
1201960	1213960	But there is no liberation of any kind of Ukrainian territory and Ukraine is not a step, not an inch, actually, closer to liberation of Donbas and of Crimea.
1213960	1215960	So politically, nothing has changed.
1215960	1220960	So what should Ukrainians do with Kursk next?
1220960	1223960	Well, hold it as long as you can, of course.
1223960	1226960	You have no other solution.
1226960	1227960	The troops are over there.
1227960	1235960	If you withdraw the troops now from Ukraine, sorry, from Russia, from the Kursk oblast, that would be a huge shame.
1235960	1236960	So another failure.
1236960	1240960	Why have you sent your troops into Russia?
1240960	1246960	Why have you lost at least 300 killed and over 1,000 wounded so far in two months of fighting?
1246960	1247960	For what?
1247960	1249960	To withdraw now?
1249960	1251960	Is that the aim of the operation?
1251960	1252960	I think not.
1252960	1254960	So hold out as long as you can.
1254960	1257960	The question is, how long can you hold?
1257960	1267960	Right now, the Ukrainians have relatively good positions, especially in what is it, Orgoka and Shep-2-Kovka area.
1267960	1272960	They are up in the hills and the Russians attempt to approach them.
1272960	1273960	They hit them from above.
1273960	1276960	They see them on time, hit them from above and so on.
1276960	1278960	So it's relatively easy.
1278960	1285960	On the other side of the same hill, they can see towards Lubimovka, so things are relatively simple.
1285960	1296960	If they lose these hills, which can happen, then it's going to become unpleasant and the entire operation is going to end with a failure.
1296960	1303960	Tom, you mentioned mistakes of our political leaders.
1303960	1316960	But previously, while describing the Vuhledar operation, you already mentioned the mistakes of Ukrainian Genstab military command.
1316960	1326960	Can you name the main mistakes and probably you could suggest how that mistakes could be corrected?
1326960	1340960	The primary mistake is the over-centralization and micromanagement by the top of commanders, but the highest commander, especially Sieski.
1340960	1353960	What he is doing was okay, for example, to sort out the troubles in areas like, well, even that was too late, in Bakhmut last year or in Avidivka early this year.
1353960	1360960	There were too many elements from different units fighting in the same sector without coordination.
1360960	1362960	But now there comes the problem.
1362960	1372960	Sieski has doubt his commanders that either they deliver him good news or they are in trouble.
1372960	1382960	So the problem is, if they are in trouble, they are going to get dismissed or something else, so he is going to command their own units over their shoulder instead of them.
1382960	1385960	Which is absolutely insane there.
1385960	1387960	You do not do such things.
1387960	1390960	You have to train your commanders.
1390960	1392960	That's Russian style as I can.
1392960	1395960	Well, more or less Russian style, yes.
1395960	1405960	The point is to train your commanders so that you as the superior commanders in Sieski's position can trust them to tell you what is going on.
1405960	1407960	Precisely the way it has happened.
1407960	1414960	And not do you some kind of crazy favors through lying to you.
1414960	1416960	That is the first point.
1416960	1422960	The second point is to train your commanders so that you can depend on them to do a good job.
1422960	1425960	And lots of Ukrainian commanders are still not doing a good job.
1425960	1430960	And I am talking about battalion and brigade commanders.
1430960	1443960	The command level in between brigade commanders and Sieski should actually be responsible for controlling the job of brigade and battalion commanders, but it's not doing that at all.
1443960	1445960	It's like it's not there.
1445960	1448960	I don't know why the officers in question actually paid.
1448960	1456960	Except perhaps from time to time to report something nice to Sieski.
1456960	1468960	Excuse me, my cat would like to take part in this interview.
1468960	1470960	Where did I stop?
1470960	1477960	Yes, you have groups of forces and they should be doing the job which Sieski is currently doing.
1477960	1482960	While Sieski's job should be to inspect and check that everything is working.
1482960	1497960	And finally, you have Genstaff which is serving Sieski as a commander instead of writing a new doctrine of the armed forces based on ten years of bloody experience of the Ukrainian armed forces.
1497960	1507960	So that all the new commanders in the future, whether tomorrow or in two years from now, are instantly taught all of these experiences.
1507960	1509960	But it's not doing that.
1509960	1517960	It's serving Sieski's purposes, which is centralized command and super control of everything and everybody.
1517960	1524960	And what a surprise amid all of this actually chaos, centralized chaos, it's not working.
1524960	1530960	It can't work and it is never going to work the way it is organized right now.
1530960	1540960	It didn't work when it was decentralized under Zaluzhnyi and it's not going to work when it's over centralized under Sieski.
1540960	1555960	Apparently, in Ukrainian armed forces, you simply can't find some middle way to delegating, to teaching your subordinates to do their job, to trusting them and so on.
1555960	1565960	This is something that is obviously sort of impossible to do. I don't know how to describe it.
1565960	1571960	And therefore, again, you have this superior commander who is controlling and commanding everybody.
1571960	1582960	And then you also have a president who is fighting a propaganda war instead of taking care to listen to advice of his military commanders
1582960	1587960	who cannot even advise him properly because they are not listening to advice from their subordinates.
1587960	1591960	Then you have, as I said, you have a bardak, excuse me, for his passion.
1591960	1597960	And this is what you have in Ukraine right now.
1597960	1602960	I mentioned also general staff and the necessity to write a new doctrine of armed forces.
1602960	1614960	This doctrine should also teach the commanders that after every single operation, they have to sit down with their subordinates and discuss what went wrong and what was done well.
1614960	1623960	This is not done. You have something like 60 brigades in Ukrainian armed forces and perhaps three are doing this right now.
1623960	1631960	The 47th, the 3rd and the 4th National Guard, perhaps the 12th National Guard as of brigade as well.
1631960	1639960	So you have less than 5% of the force is doing debriefs after operations. This is a catastrophe.
1639960	1648960	This means that all the lessons learned and paid in blood every single day are lost because nobody is learning from them.
1648960	1652960	We have seen this also in the Air Force and Air Defense Force.
1652960	1663960	Oh, everything is fine. We are shooting down Shahids, we are shooting down Kinshaws, we are shooting down Zircons, we are shooting down the Mars people and Jupiter people as well.
1663960	1675960	And then 12, at least 12 Russian cruise missiles fly through that super turbo air defense system and hit a hospital in downtown of Kiev in July.
1675960	1688960	And what is the Air Force reporting? It was just 12 missiles and we have shot down all of them, including those you can see on the videos coming down and hitting the hospital and killing women and children.
1688960	1701960	The same also with F-16 which was shot down by armed forces. How long is it now? One month? We are going to investigate. One month later?
1701960	1704960	Oh, who we? We should investigate this or what?
1704960	1707960	Excuse me, Tom, let's leave F-16.
1707960	1720960	Just a second, it came so far that the Americans do not trust themselves anymore to ask what has happened to that F-16 because they know then there is going to be no reply.
1720960	1721960	Sorry.
1721960	1728960	I wanted to say that let's leave F-16 for a bit later. We have a separate part for them.
1728960	1743960	Our last question in this section, we already told you that lots of our audience is located in the southern Ukraine in Kherson.
1743960	1753960	What's your predictions for Kherson and Kherson region for this fall and the next year?
1753960	1758960	My predictions, I said I'm not making predictions, I'm making post-assessments.
1758960	1760960	Let's say estimate.
1760960	1769960	Okay, okay, okay, estimate. Just a second, I'm powering up a map of the battlefield.
1769960	1789960	What you can expect next is that the Russians are going to attack from Wukhle, the directions towards what is the place first in the direction of Bahatia and Constantinople in order to, because there is nothing in between.
1789960	1795960	There is just open terrain. There are no hills, no forests, just open fields.
1795960	1810960	So they have something like 30 kilometers up to there and this is where they are going to close this corner with something like a dozen of Ukrainian brigades in between of Wukhle and southern side of the battlefield at Pokrovsk.
1810960	1824960	In Pokrovsk itself, you have to expect them to drive around such fortifications still left in front of the town like Selidovje, for example, that's what they are already doing.
1824960	1835960	They are trying to surround Selidovje by an advance from southern side and then from the northern side as well because the 15th Karadag is doing a very good job with defending Selidovje.
1835960	1849960	So they cannot take the town without surrounding it first and those forcing the 15th National Guard Brigade to withdraw from there in order to avoid that encirclement.
1849960	1863960	So once they do that, they are going to go up to Lisik and Chefchenko and search for a way to start surrounding Pokrovsk as well.
1863960	1865960	That is Pokrovsk.
1866960	1880960	The rest of that operation, I mean, once they are in Pokrovsk, well, then I'm not sure what exactly they're going to do but they're probably going to try to finish off Toretsk in between.
1880960	1889960	Toretsk is going to take them another two or three months probably to complete but not much longer so we can expect that Toretsk is going to fall by the end of this year.
1889960	1904960	So Pokrovsk, I would say by March, reaching Pavlovgrad might become their next objective but that is going to take them another year.
1904960	1910960	So sometimes in summer, autumn next year, they might get all the way to Pavlovgrad.
1910960	1915960	What else do we have in between? Up the front line?
1916960	1920960	Excuse me, may I ask you to move? It's southern to Kerson.
1920960	1933960	To remain in the south. Well, basically they need not attacking in the south, they need not attacking southern Zaporozhia because everything is doing along their ideas in the east.
1933960	1946960	So why attacking where they are not going to get to as we have seen this summer in Robotinia area, for example, in what is that?
1946960	1955960	Excuse me, just a check to map south of Velikonovo-Silka in Urogyne, for example, okay, they have captured Urogyne but they cannot hold it.
1955960	1965960	So why wasting their resources by deploying them somewhere else if they are successful in the east? And they are successful in the east.
1965960	1972960	So can I conclude that the situation for Kerson will remain the same for the next year?
1972960	1980960	Yeah, for the next year and a half. As long as not something substantial happens in Kiev, for example.
