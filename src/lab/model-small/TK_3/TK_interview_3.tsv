0	6000	Thank you, Tom, for such a comprehensive explanation of our situation.
6000	9000	We have a few questions left.
9000	16000	The last one from this section is about Russian and Iranian trade.
16000	26000	Everyone in Ukraine knows that Russia buys Shaheads and ballistic missiles and everything else from Iran.
26000	34000	From time to time, you're expressing your doubts about the actual amount of such military trade.
34000	37000	Could you please share with us your thoughts?
37000	40000	There is no alliance between Russia and Iran.
40000	45000	There is a relation between a customer and seller.
49000	54000	And there is lots of rivalry and lots of mistrust, especially from Iranians.
54000	59000	So all these stories about ballistic missiles, where are they?
59000	63000	I haven't seen any kind of Iranian ballistic missiles in Russia yet.
63000	66000	Because we already destroyed all of them?
66000	67000	Of course.
67000	69000	A few weeks ago.
69000	75000	You have even destroyed the secret depots where they were stored, you know?
75000	77000	Okay, seriously now.
77000	81000	There are no ballistic missiles in Iran, ballistic missiles in Russia.
81000	85000	Except they have delivered them the last five days, say.
85000	87000	No, it's not going to happen.
87000	91000	And for a simple reason that the Iranians do not trust the Russians.
91000	95000	I mean, study a little bit the history of Russia and Iran and their rivalry.
95000	102000	And you're going to see that they hate each other almost like Ukrainians and Russians are hating each other nowadays.
102000	113000	So, and then check the history of the last 20, 30 years and all the repeated attempts of Tehran to buy major weapons systems from Russia.
113000	124000	And every single one, almost every single one was screwed up, excuse me for his passion, in one way or the other, by the Russians.
124000	133000	And then you have the situation in the Caspian Sea where the Iranians would like to bring in their ships for exploration of gas and oil.
133000	144000	They know that it is there at the bottom of the sea, but they cannot bring their ships to explore it, to find it and to start drilling for it and exploiting it.
144000	147000	Because the Russians wouldn't let them do so.
147000	152000	You cannot bring such a ship, these are big ships, they are very wide, they are very heavy.
152000	159000	And you cannot, the Iranians cannot build them on their own, on the Caspian, on their coast of the Caspian Sea.
159000	166000	So they would have to bring them via the river and channel systems of Russia from the Black Sea and so on.
166000	168000	You know this better than me.
168000	171000	So, the Russians wouldn't let them.
171000	173000	They wouldn't let them.
173000	176000	So this is the problem number one for the Iranians.
176000	187000	Number two, I said every single major arms deal between Moscow and Tehran of the last 20 years was, 30 years actually, was messed up by the Russians.
187000	195000	There would be an agreement, a contract was signed, Iranians would pay 50% advance and nothing happened.
195000	203000	All the Russia, or if something happened, the Russians would deliver something entirely different than the Iranians have ordered.
203000	209000	For example, the Iranians have ordered S-300 air defense systems, long range air defense systems.
209000	215000	Russians delivered tour, short range air defense systems and such things.
215000	224000	And in some cases, for example, Iranians have in one case, they went to Moscow and said, look, we want MiG-31s.
224000	232000	Here is one billion for them, right on the table, deliver them in one or two years whenever.
232000	237000	The Russians pocketed money and did nothing.
237000	249000	And then two years later, after lots of complaints from Tehran, the Russians delivered yet more tours and what was it, books and such things instead.
249000	252000	So why should Iranians trust them?
252000	254000	They have no reason.
254000	261000	Shahid's UAVs, attack UAVs was an exception from the rule.
261000	270000	Why? Because the Russians were so stupid to pay for something that is worth perhaps $5,000 to pay $200,000 per single Shahid.
270000	273000	Your own hackers have found this out.
273000	279000	So it was a brilliant opportunity, nothing special, no high technology from China actually.
279000	283000	Okay, let them have it. We are cashing millions from this.
283000	286000	And that is why Russians have such weaponry.
286000	291000	But other Iranian weaponry, I haven't seen anything of that kind in Russia.
291000	299000	I've seen mortars and mortar shells of Iranian origins in Ukraine, but not in Russia.
299000	303000	So, that much about that.
303000	312000	And even if this fat, everybody is calling it ballistic missile, this is not a ballistic missile, this is an artillery rocket.
312000	319000	It is similar like BM-27 or BM-30, which Ukraine is also operating, BM-27, not BM-30.
319000	321000	And which Russia is already operating.
321000	330000	This is a heavy rocket, which is relatively precise and has a range of 100-120 km.
330000	338000	Of course, if Iranians would deliver any to Russia, that would be a big problem for Ukraine, because they have a big warhead.
338000	348000	And if Iranians would deliver even just a few hundreds of them to Russia, Russian firepower would increase significantly.
348000	355000	But so far I haven't seen an atom of evidence that any have been delivered to Russia.
355000	357000	And there is a good reason for this.
357000	362000	Because, for example, Iranian Air Force would like to acquire Su-35s.
362000	371000	But if the Iranians acquire Su-35s, they do not only want the aircraft, but they want also the capability to maintain this aircraft at home,
371000	377000	which in turn means they need the capability to manufacture spare parts for this aircraft at home.
377000	383000	And the Russians, this is something the Russians won't deliver even to the Chinese not to talk about Iranians.
384000	392000	So, as a bargain for such an eventuality, Iranians are holding back their ballistic missiles.
392000	399000	And now, when Iran is almost in a state of war with Israel, even more so.
399000	406000	They are not crazy to say, let's sell out our entire missile arsenal to Russia.
406000	408000	We are going to earn a few billion.
408000	415000	But if they sell off their ballistic missiles, they have nothing to shoot at Israel.
415000	422000	Therefore, all of these stories about thousands of Iranian ballistic missiles and blah, blah, blah, blah, to Russia.
422000	434000	And finally, after all of this, I said mistrust, bad experiences and so on.
434000	445000	Iranians have attempted to enter sort of strategically alliance with Putin several times and he has turned them down every single time.
445000	452000	They have absolutely no reason to insist on some kind of alliance with him now. Why should they?
452000	459000	So, even this story with alliance and whatever else, this is all lots of fantasy and at least as much hysteria.
459000	472000	And if nothing else, it's usually used in order for some, especially in the West, for some propagating some third point of issues.
472000	482000	Like, for example, the first time that there was a talk about the sale of F-35s to Israel, there was promptly a report that Iran is buying 100 Su-27s.
482000	492000	I mean, which is nonsense. Of course, Iran never bought Su-27s, but because it was buying them, because of fake news, Israel should get F-35s, no problem.
492000	494000	This is how it works.
494000	499000	Thank you, Tom. Let's hope they will not deal with each other.
499000	504000	Last few questions and let's try to cover them shortly.
504000	512000	The first one, will Russian Federation complete the railway to Crimea this year?
512000	516000	Yes. Isn't it already to Melitopol?
516000	526000	I'm not sure. Do you think that this will cause huge consequences for us?
526000	538000	Of course, of course, because a railway from what is the place, Niprov down to Melitopol, for example, it's making things massively easier for the Russians.
538000	550000	They do not need a catch bridge anymore. They can transport, what, 5,000 kg, 5,000 tons, sorry, a day to Melitopol. It's perfect for them.
550000	563000	And the Ukrainians can, of course, try to hit that with missiles and so on and so on, but the Russians have it easier to repair a railway, then it's much more complicated to repair a bridge instead.
563000	567000	So it is a perfect solution for them.
567000	577000	Thank you. Regarding the bridge, what do you think, is it possible to destroy the Crimean bridge with missiles?
577000	591000	With missiles alone? Not really. You can damage it temporarily, close it for a few weeks or even for two months, and that's it.
591000	598000	But you really need big missiles and really have to hit, a very precise hit in a specific part of the construction.
599000	601000	You mean ballistic missiles?
601000	617000	Ballistic missiles, yes. No, no, cruise missiles, okay. I mean, it doesn't matter. You need something like a 2,000 kg warhead and this must be extremely precise in hitting this particular part of the construction in order to drop a bridge.
617000	627000	It is pointless to hit the middle of the bridge because you're just going to create a gap in the road. What is going to happen? We have seen this on so many other examples, Antonovsky bridge.
628000	641000	Almost two years ago. So, excuse me. Right now, I don't see Ukraine having an ability to drop the catch bridge.
641000	655000	Okay, thank you. Tom, we have the last question. You recently described the scenario for ending the war in the Middle East. You yourself called it almost fantastic.
655000	657000	Yeah, it is fantasy, yes.
657000	663000	Yes, so could you please describe more or less realistic scenario for ending the war in Ukraine?
663000	678000	No, I can't because I have no idea how to end it. I mean, there is so much reform necessary alone in Ukraine. You would need to reorganize the way your government is thinking, not only to say acting.
678000	691000	You would need to bring your population all to one side and say, guys, we are really in danger of extermination. If you are sitting at home and watching TV, you are screwing up all of us.
691000	703000	You don't even have this psychology. I mean, okay, you have lots of volunteers and people are really trying to help the country and so on, but a big part of the population is just sitting there and doing nothing for Ukraine.
704000	712000	Then, as next, you would have to understand that you need many more women in your armed forces in your industry and so on and so on.
712000	719000	I cannot understand that you still have unemployed people at war. You have unemployed people in Ukraine. How can this happen?
719000	727000	I said your defense sector is idling around, working at 40% to 60% of capacity.
727000	737000	And even if it would certainly like to work at higher capacity, but it can't because the government does not have the money for that.
737000	746000	And so you have serious problems, very extensive problems with you. I have no idea how to solve all of this.
746000	761000	So therefore, I have no clear idea how can you solve the problem. I mean, ideally, you would manufacture, let's say, 500 to 1000 tanks a year, and then you would manufacture a similar number of heavy infantry fighting vehicles.
761000	772000	That means vehicles as well armored as tanks. You would manufacture not one million FPV drones a year, but five million of them.
772000	781000	You would have enough pilots and crews for all of this. You would equip your entire armed forces. You would have, ideally, you would have enough artillery ammunition.
781000	795000	And even more important, you would have such missiles like FAT, or rockets, actually, sorry, artillery rockets like FAT, which means you can deliver a warhead of 100, 200, 300 kilogram over range of 100 kilometers.
795000	807000	Ideally, you would need something like 20, at least 20 Patriot Sam batteries, plus a similar number of IST and SamT. You don't have anything of this.
807000	813000	And I don't see you getting anything of this, but even enough to patch up your air defenses and so on and so on.
813000	828000	So I have no solution right now. What you need is plenty of firepower. And I mean really firepower in terms of 100, 200, 300 kilogram warheads been delivered and obliterating entire Russian units.
828000	834000	This is happening perhaps once a month, but this is too little. You would need this happening every single day.
834000	846000	I also do not understand, I mean, how long is it now that you have got the first high mass that was in summer 2022? So two years. And you're still not manufacturing high mass at home?
846000	855000	I cannot understand this. Why not? You're all the time waiting for Americans to have mercy and send you another 30 rockets.
855000	875000	Why is nobody manufacturing ATACOMS in Ukraine? Out of mind of what? Instead, the government has been, as far as I have heard, is letting the Americans buy agricultural surfaces, real estate.
875000	884000	I mean, it's not letting them buy directly, but it says, okay, if some foreigner wants to buy it, please, let's do it. And Ukrainians don't have the money to do so, so foreigners are buying it.
884000	893000	And the first foreigners who are doing it in the soil are the Americans. So you're going to end as what?
893000	908000	Heavy indebted, lucky home territory. I don't know where this heading. I have no solution for this problem, excuse me. I mean, Middle East is perfect in comparison.
908000	932000	Thank you, Tom. I hope our audience will make appropriate conclusions from your words. And at the end, I would just mention that we're not publishing all of Tom's texts. That's, I'm talking to our audience, all of Tom's texts for different reasons.
932000	961000	But if you are looking for an interesting, competent overview of the events in the Middle East, I would probably suggest you to take a look at Tom's blog, because I believe that a person who spent almost 40 years studying this region
961000	985000	probably knows a bit more comparing to those experts you are watching on our TV. So thank you so much, Tom. It was a big pleasure to talk to you. And they hope we will have another interview a bit later.
985000	996000	Thank you very much for inviting me as well. And please keep yourself safe and do the best for your country and for all of you.
996000	1000000	Thank you, Tom. Goodbye, everyone. Stay safe.
