0	8440	Thank you, Tom. Let's move to the second chapter, which is called Air War. The first
8440	20600	question will be about Russian Cubs, guided bombs. There are reports that Russia has increased
20600	29560	the range of its Cubs from 30 kilometers up to even 80 kilometers. The question is how
29560	37440	much further can this range be increased? Okay, first start. Russia didn't increase the range.
37440	45880	The range was 60 to 70 kilometers already last year. This is simply physics. And this physics
45880	50080	comes from the weight of the weapon combined with the speed of the aircraft carrying it. At
50080	57440	the time it's released, plus the attitude of the aircraft. At the time it's released in the bomb.
57440	69040	So what happens, SO-34 comes in at an altitude between 9,000 and 12,000 meters at a high subsonic
69040	79040	speed, which means something like 1,100 kilometers per hour. So then it enters a shallow
79040	86800	climb, flies like this, and releases the bomb. The bombs drop from the aircraft, open their wings,
86800	96280	and then they glide over 60 to 70 kilometers in a parabolic trajectory until hitting the ground.
96280	104400	So the point is now the following. Depending on the sector of the front line, where they deploy
104440	111840	such bombs, in some cases, Russians are free to fly their SO-34s all the way over the Ukrainian
111840	117560	positions. For example, in Wuchleda area, the last two weeks, they were free to fly over Wuchleda.
117560	124080	Because the glorious general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces didn't take care to deploy at least
124080	131920	proper air defenses on that place. Therefore, they could reach 70 kilometers behind Wuchleda.
134800	147640	But in other sectors, for example, Kursk, they can't. In Kursk, the Ukrainian air defenses are strong
147640	153160	enough that the Russians have to release their bombs from 70 kilometers away, from, let's say,
153160	159040	50 kilometers behind their front line, to reach a target only 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian
160040	163360	front line, 10 to 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian front line. And then it appears to
163360	169640	plenty of people that the range is shorter than just 30 kilometers. In other cases,
169640	175920	the Russians do not need to hit something that is further away than 30 kilometers. So they are
175920	180840	releasing their bombs and they are striking targets just 30 kilometers away. Because the target is
180840	187000	simply closer and less well protected. So, correspondingly, the range was always 60 to 70
187000	194560	kilometers. And now it might be increased to around 100 kilometers with the help of rocket
194560	200240	boosters. That means there's a rocket engine, rocket motor, sorry, installed on the rear,
200240	206360	at the rear of the of the UMPK. And this is empowering the bomb. And instead of glide bomb,
206360	211760	it's becoming a guided missile de facto. So that is the answer to your question.
212720	222200	That's clear, Tom. Is it is it true that Russians already developed not
222200	234440	far flying Cubs, but also more powerful Cubs? I mean that more more heavier ones. For example,
234800	245160	everyone knows about Cup 500. But some people already say about Cup 900 or something like that.
245160	252880	Okay, let me clarify this. In the Soviet and therefore Russian Air Force, you have specific
252880	262480	calibers of bombs, 250 kilogram, 500 kilogram, 1000, 1500 kilogram, 3000, 5000 and 9000 kilogram
262480	269600	bombs. Okay, these are the biggest bombs. A FAB, Fugas, an aviation, a bomb, 5000,
269600	278480	9000 was the biggest one. And this 9000 means it is 9000 kilogram heavy or somewhere like that.
278480	286800	So correspondingly, for a 9000 kilogram bomb, you need a bomb which can carry a bomb weighting 9 tons.
286800	296520	That is the first point. The second point is, in order to make a glide bomb out of such a bomb,
296520	302400	you need very big wings, big wing surface. And the bigger the wing surface, the further it's flying.
302400	309040	Which in turn means you need the bomb itself is getting ever grow bigger and bigger.
309040	319600	Correspondingly, there is a big problem already with the bomb in caliber of 3000 kilogram of 3 tons.
319600	328720	The construction, this UMP key construction, this module which is installed on top of the bomb,
328720	336120	splitting wings, so it becomes a glide bomb, is so big and so heavy that the bomb is weighting
336120	343560	something like 4 tons. That means that a single SO-34 can only carry one at once, also because of
343560	351680	its sheer size. It is not only the size, it is the weight as well, because you have to consider,
351680	358320	you put a 4000 kilogram bomb under an aircraft and to connect it to the aircraft, you need a hard point,
359280	366400	which is, we call this pylon in English, which can carry 4000 kilogram.
369440	376480	And this pylon weights another 1000 kilogram. So now you have 4000 kilogram of a bomb,
376480	381920	1000 kilogram of the pylon and then you put that on the aircraft, on SO-34, in between the engines.
382880	387680	And you have, in this way, you have put 4000 kilogram on the aircraft.
387680	393920	SO-34 could theoretically carry 8000 kilogram of bombs, but then it's going to fly for the next 200 kilometers.
393920	402880	But because of the threat of Russian bases, they have moved SO-34s away from bases close to Ukraine,
402880	407920	therefore they have to fly very far away, from very far away, from warground in similar places,
408480	415280	and therefore they carry only one such bomb at once. So that is theory. Why? Because so far,
415280	421680	all I've seen, the biggest I've seen as deployed, was 1500 kilogram.
423440	426480	You're talking only about Russians or?
426480	434880	Russians, Russians, just Russians. 1500 kilogram. It could be that they have dropped
434880	441040	one or two, 3000, there are prototypes of 3000 kilogram heavy UMPK or carb bomb, if you like it.
442080	446800	It could be they have deployed two or three of this, but I haven't seen any clear evidence,
446800	452080	any definite evidence that there is such a weapon in serious production in Russia.
452080	459440	At least not its UMPK module. There are 3000 kilogram bombs in Russian arsenals,
459440	466400	and they are in production as well, but there are no UMPK modules which can be installed on such bombs
466400	472720	and manufactured in serious. So most of the times they're actually dropping bombs,
472720	478880	UMPK bombs or carb bombs, if you like, of 250 kilogram and 500 kilogram. From time to time,
478880	487360	they're dropping those of 1000, 1500 kilogram. But 3000 kilogram, I haven't seen clear evidence for
487360	492640	any so far. Even somewhere throughout the world, not only in Ukraine?
496480	503520	When we're talking about around the world. Yes, the question is, are there any examples of
505120	512880	applying such huge stuff, at least somewhere, maybe on the Middle East or somewhere else?
513600	519520	Okay, I see now what you mean. Here we have to distinguish between bombs designed and manufactured,
519520	525440	originally manufactured in Soviet Union, and nowadays in Russia, and between Western bombs.
525440	531040	Why? Because Western bombs are made of parts which should assemble together as necessary.
531040	538560	They are very flexible, they are modular, but they are construction. On Soviet dash Russian bombs,
538640	546080	everything is welded together. That's it. Bomb is delivered to the air base as it was manufactured,
546080	552000	as it was put together already in the factory. You can't change anything about it. So the question,
552960	558720	fundamental question or the fundamental issue while developing the carb or the UMPK
559360	565600	was how to make a module which you can put on such a bomb which is already ready for use.
566320	573920	And this means that every different caliber of bomb needs a different UMPK module. This module
573920	580320	must be ever bigger and bigger because it needs ever bigger wings so that it can reach this 60 to 70
580320	588320	kilometers. Correspondingly, nobody tried to do anything of this kind outside of Russia,
589280	597280	at least not with bombs bigger than 250 kilograms. North Koreans have a similar system,
597280	607680	like UMPK, which is useful for bombs caliber 250, perhaps 500 kilograms. And I've seen them in
607680	615440	use by Sudanese Air Force over Yemen, for example. This is also 7 years ago or something like that.
616160	623280	So this is all I have seen in regards to Soviet-Russian bombs. Then it comes to western bombs. The
623280	628080	situation is entirely different because western bombs are modular and you have you can put the
628080	634800	same kit, so-called kit, on different caliber of bombs. You have bombs caliber 125 kilograms,
634800	643040	125 kilograms, 250, 500, and 1000, actually 907, but let's say 1000 kilograms. So
645040	651280	you put the same guidance kit and the same set of wings on different caliber of bombs.
653200	661600	You can also use specialized casings or bomb bodies like BLU-109, this is this
661600	668560	bunker-buster bomb of 1000 kilogram caliber, or 2000 pounds, as we have seen when Israel
668560	677040	assassinated the Nasrallah. This is a specially hardened casing, which makes sure that bomb penetrates,
677040	682240	you know, goes down through the ground, 20, 30 meters through the ground before detonating.
682240	689200	But the guidance system and the wings system for this bomb is still the same like on any
689200	696720	general bomb, caliber 250 kilometers, because these bodies are all very flexible and modular.
696720	704480	So this is a difference. However, there are no heavier, at least not in widespread tactical
704480	712960	service, no heavier air released bombs in western service or of western origin than 1000 kilogram.
713280	721360	There is one type, this massive penetrator, whatever, 10,000 kilogram bomb in the United States,
722160	727520	but this is carried only by B-2 bombers, and that's it, not a tactical aircraft can deploy it.
727520	734800	So the heaviest bombs of this caliber are around 1000 kilograms in the west.
734880	742960	Tom, what about Ukraine? Can Ukraine, for example, use our favorite F-16s to apply such stuff?
743840	747760	Yes, of course. You could put two 1000 kilogram bombs on F-16.
750320	756400	What do you think? Is Ukrainian command going to use it?
757760	763600	Yes, you have already underdeveloped such a weapon. I'm just not sure if it is caliber 1000 kilogram,
763600	767440	but you certainly have such underdevelopment, a weapon of 500 kilogram.
768640	774400	That's very interesting. So let's stay on our favorite topic. Tom, how could you,
775920	777680	what's your opinion of the
781920	784960	using of western aircraft in Ukraine?
786640	792880	Look, in order to use western aircraft in Ukraine, you have to change the entire system,
792960	797600	how aviation is operating in Ukraine, and this is happening very, very slowly.
798240	807280	It took the delivery of F-16s to Ukraine for the top civilian authority in Ukraine,
807280	815760	I forgot the name, sorry now, to write a new set of regulations for pilots, for ground personnel,
815760	822240	for ground control and so on, and for radar systems and so on. So before that, you still had
822240	830080	the same system like in the Soviet Union. So now you have to, in order to use, the next step in
830080	837600	using western aircraft is to teach your people, your troops, your ground crews and your pilots to
837600	845200	speak English, which is the next hurdle because despite all the talk about we are going to buy
845200	851040	western aircraft, whether a sub-grip pen or F-16s or whatever else, of the last let's say 10 years
851040	857920	or something like that, nobody in the Air Force took here to organize English language courses
858560	865200	for pilots and for ground personnel, which means that every time Ukraine sends pilots and ground
865200	872720	personnel for training in the West, they first have to spend six months at least learning English.
873360	880320	So now once they learn English, only then can they start training actual flying training or aircraft.
880320	886800	Before they start this actual training, flight training on aircraft, they have to learn the
886800	894160	basic principles, procedures of flying in the West, which are fundamentally different than those in
894160	901120	the former Soviet Union. So even then, actually, they still do not instantly start training in
901840	909760	aircraft, but they first learn the procedures and terminology in order to start learning flying
909760	914960	aircraft or maintaining aircraft or arming them, refueling them and so on and so on. So you have
916240	923520	every time a new group of Ukrainians is sent to West to learn flying F-16s or whatever else,
923520	928720	it takes at least a year to get them so far that they start actually learning to fly the aircraft.
932000	938080	Correspondingly, from this point of view, you can instantly calculate how long is it going to take
938080	945920	for an entire Ukrainian Air Force to convert to, let's say, F-16s. This is just F-16s.
947040	951680	Another part is going to convert to Gripens. At least a unit is going to fly
952640	955920	this Sub-Evox aircraft and similar stuff.
956320	961680	So this is a process that is going to take years.
966160	975840	Can we say that today is too early to make conclusions about applying F-16s and other
975840	980720	aircraft in Ukraine? It's not too early. It's not too early. Don't worry. Let's say,
980720	987280	even if the Dutch would junk all of their 40 or whatever F-16s that are still around
987280	992160	up on Ukraine tomorrow in the morning, it will still take you one to two years to train enough
992160	998640	personnel to fly all of them. You do not have people enough people. Someone is already flying.
999760	1005040	Just flying over Ukraine. You don't have enough pilots. You don't have enough ground personnel.
1005040	1009840	You don't have the support infrastructure. You don't have the spares. You don't have
1010720	1014560	maintenance facilities in Ukraine. You don't have it. It's simply not there.
1015120	1025840	You mean that those aircraft which already fly above Ukraine, they do not conduct any military
1025840	1033440	mission? Oh, no. I do not say that. What do they do? There are five F-16s in Ukraine. This is the
1033440	1040080	group that was delivered two months ago, and they are flying air combat sorties, air defense sorties.
1040880	1049280	I'm not dispute about this. But increasing this number to, let's say, 30 or something meaningful
1050640	1055840	to a number that is making sense or having its effect upon developments on the battlefield,
1056240	1071040	it's going to take its time. Okay, that's clear. We also had a question that is being asked throughout
1071040	1082960	Ukraine for about three years. Why don't we still have our own iron dome above Ukraine?
1083440	1095440	What's about Ukrainian air defense? Where should I start? Well, I mean, you are Ukrainian. You
1095440	1099440	know it better than me. You grew up in Ukraine, if nothing else. I've never been to Ukraine.
1100000	1109200	The first problem is that from the independence in 1991, 1992, until 2014, nobody cared about
1109280	1113920	Ukrainian armed forces. So they were constantly decreased, decreased, decreased, decreased,
1113920	1122000	downsized, downsized. Units were constantly disbanded. Air bases were closed. Nobody needed
1122000	1130880	armed forces. There was peace everywhere. Everything was so beautiful. And well, it's a matter of
1130880	1136880	fact that Ukrainian economy wasn't particularly good. So you had a situation where there was no money
1137360	1142480	for the city. And therefore, although you had excellent companies which could
1143200	1150080	design a manufacturing weaponry, nobody was buying this weaponry. And so these companies,
1150080	1156400	in some cases, ended working for the Russians and not only a few of them. So when the Russians needed
1156400	1163200	some kind of guided, tactical guided weapons, air-to-air missiles and so on, these were made,
1163520	1167840	at least major parts of them, major assemblies of them were made in Ukraine.
1169280	1173520	And then the Russians would either use these at home or sell them abroad, export them
1174400	1180800	to whatever customers. So now the 2014 came and there are lots of announcements and blah, blah,
1180800	1190240	blah, blah. And nothing happened. Or the most that has happened was to overhaul MiG-29s and S-25s
1191200	1199440	very few, F-22s, S-27s. So they were overhauled. That means that they were taken apart,
1200000	1205360	cleaned, refurbished, most important pieces were replaced. And then everything was assembled,
1205360	1211200	painted anew. And they received a new radio, they received new weapons management systems.
1212000	1217200	MiG-29s have even received this new computer, which is improving the performance of their radar.
1217200	1224640	Beautiful. Yeah. And that's it. Nobody came to the idea, obviously, to finance the installation of
1224640	1229600	or development research and installation of actually serious production and installation
1229600	1237600	of new air-to-air missiles on MiG-29s or S-27s. So this is the first point. The second point is
1238800	1245920	in order to have such weaponry, whether air-to-air missiles or surface-to-air missiles,
1245920	1254800	you should have had somebody who would manufacture them. Basically, you had several design bureaus
1254800	1266000	like Luch, for example, who have designs of new air-to-air missile and its surface launched version
1267440	1273760	with a range of something like 100 kilometers, which is something which your armed forces
1273760	1281360	would need urgently right now, and then not in a few examples, but in thousands. But it's not there.
1281360	1288480	Why? Well, because obviously, somebody there is convinced that these are old companies,
1288480	1292800	that they are too complex and they're wasting too much money and doing nothing and they're
1292800	1300880	useful and to whatever else. Therefore, nothing is done. And now, even if Luch would start,
1300880	1306800	actually give Artyom the production to launch this production, the serious production of this
1306800	1312240	new weaponry, it would take at least a year to introduce it to service. On the other side,
1312240	1318400	meanwhile, Artyom was heavily hit several times by the Russians this summer, so I don't even know
1318400	1323840	how much of its underground facilities are still actually operational. So why didn't this happen?
1323840	1332080	Because nobody in Kiev had the far side enough to say, okay, guys, we have to build up,
1332080	1337680	we have to invest into our defense sector, we have to reform it on time and then let it
1338560	1344240	start manufacturing new weaponry on time. Nothing happened in these regards, actually, even as of,
1345200	1353760	was it Autumn 2022, perhaps in Autumn the last year. And therefore, you do not have
1354800	1359600	in serious production, you do not have new ballistic missiles, you do not have air-to-air
1359600	1366880	missiles, you do not have surface-to-air missiles, although your companies have ready to use designs
1366880	1372960	for them and they could put them into production. The next point is also that there is always this
1373040	1379840	petty bickering about who is going to get the money for this. You have advisors to the
1379840	1386160	government who are complaining that Artyom and Luch, they are old and this is too complex,
1386160	1391680	and let's not give them money. Let's get this stuff from the West, which is nonsensical.
1392320	1398960	It would have been better to pay Artyom already back in 2022 to start manufacturing this new
1398960	1404000	air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles. However, the government back then was convinced
1404000	1408000	now this war is going to end, whatever, in the six months, 12 months or something.
1409600	1416320	Therefore, you didn't launch production on time. Even the Neptune anti-ship missile,
1416320	1421920	which is meanwhile also developed as a cruise missile, was available on in prototype form,
1421920	1430160	some 12 or 15 examples around in February 2022. This first successful deployment against
1430800	1437280	Russian guided missile cruiser Moskva was actually something like an ultimate test of the weapon.
1437920	1444000	Before that, there was no operational unit in the Ukrainian Armed Forces operating
1444960	1453840	Neptune's. And ever since, how many are manufactured? 15 perhaps a year. 15 a year,
1453840	1460480	where you could need actually, let's say at least 500 of them, and probably then develop them
1461840	1467280	into land attack versions, which could be launched from Asia 24, so you don't need to beg
1467680	1474400	Germans, British, French and the Americans for more storm shadows and similar stuff.
1475360	1480480	You could have had all of this already years ago. Your government just failed to reorganize the
1480480	1487360	defense sector, to finance it properly, to launch the production. Right now, your defense sector is
1487360	1496320	working with 40 to 60 percent of its capacity, which means actually that people are sitting there
1496400	1501600	and working something like let's say four to five hours a day instead of eight hours a day in three
1501600	1509360	shifts. This is insane. You're facing a war of extermination and your defense sector is sitting
1509360	1516080	there and waiting for better times. Because there's nobody in Kiev capable of reorganizing
1516720	1523200	the financing of the sector and then the management of the sector itself. Nothing is happening.
1523920	1527680	There are always big announcements, but until somebody from the West comes in,
1528320	1533040	pays a lot of money probably somewhere, and then invests a lot of money into one or the other
