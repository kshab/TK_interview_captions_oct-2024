00:00.000 --> 00:08.440
Thank you, Tom. Let's move to the second chapter, which is called Air War. The first

00:08.440 --> 00:20.600
question will be about Russian Cubs, guided bombs. There are reports that Russia has increased

00:20.600 --> 00:29.560
the range of its Cubs from 30 kilometers up to even 80 kilometers. The question is how

00:29.560 --> 00:37.440
much further can this range be increased? Okay, first start. Russia didn't increase the range.

00:37.440 --> 00:45.880
The range was 60 to 70 kilometers already last year. This is simply physics. And this physics

00:45.880 --> 00:50.080
comes from the weight of the weapon combined with the speed of the aircraft carrying it. At

00:50.080 --> 00:57.440
the time it's released, plus the attitude of the aircraft. At the time it's released in the bomb.

00:57.440 --> 01:09.040
So what happens, SO-34 comes in at an altitude between 9,000 and 12,000 meters at a high subsonic

01:09.040 --> 01:19.040
speed, which means something like 1,100 kilometers per hour. So then it enters a shallow

01:19.040 --> 01:26.800
climb, flies like this, and releases the bomb. The bombs drop from the aircraft, open their wings,

01:26.800 --> 01:36.280
and then they glide over 60 to 70 kilometers in a parabolic trajectory until hitting the ground.

01:36.280 --> 01:44.400
So the point is now the following. Depending on the sector of the front line, where they deploy

01:44.440 --> 01:51.840
such bombs, in some cases, Russians are free to fly their SO-34s all the way over the Ukrainian

01:51.840 --> 01:57.560
positions. For example, in Wuchleda area, the last two weeks, they were free to fly over Wuchleda.

01:57.560 --> 02:04.080
Because the glorious general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces didn't take care to deploy at least

02:04.080 --> 02:11.920
proper air defenses on that place. Therefore, they could reach 70 kilometers behind Wuchleda.

02:14.800 --> 02:27.640
But in other sectors, for example, Kursk, they can't. In Kursk, the Ukrainian air defenses are strong

02:27.640 --> 02:33.160
enough that the Russians have to release their bombs from 70 kilometers away, from, let's say,

02:33.160 --> 02:39.040
50 kilometers behind their front line, to reach a target only 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian

02:40.040 --> 02:43.360
front line, 10 to 20 kilometers behind the Ukrainian front line. And then it appears to

02:43.360 --> 02:49.640
plenty of people that the range is shorter than just 30 kilometers. In other cases,

02:49.640 --> 02:55.920
the Russians do not need to hit something that is further away than 30 kilometers. So they are

02:55.920 --> 03:00.840
releasing their bombs and they are striking targets just 30 kilometers away. Because the target is

03:00.840 --> 03:07.000
simply closer and less well protected. So, correspondingly, the range was always 60 to 70

03:07.000 --> 03:14.560
kilometers. And now it might be increased to around 100 kilometers with the help of rocket

03:14.560 --> 03:20.240
boosters. That means there's a rocket engine, rocket motor, sorry, installed on the rear,

03:20.240 --> 03:26.360
at the rear of the of the UMPK. And this is empowering the bomb. And instead of glide bomb,

03:26.360 --> 03:31.760
it's becoming a guided missile de facto. So that is the answer to your question.

03:32.720 --> 03:42.200
That's clear, Tom. Is it is it true that Russians already developed not

03:42.200 --> 03:54.440
far flying Cubs, but also more powerful Cubs? I mean that more more heavier ones. For example,

03:54.800 --> 04:05.160
everyone knows about Cup 500. But some people already say about Cup 900 or something like that.

04:05.160 --> 04:12.880
Okay, let me clarify this. In the Soviet and therefore Russian Air Force, you have specific

04:12.880 --> 04:22.480
calibers of bombs, 250 kilogram, 500 kilogram, 1000, 1500 kilogram, 3000, 5000 and 9000 kilogram

04:22.480 --> 04:29.600
bombs. Okay, these are the biggest bombs. A FAB, Fugas, an aviation, a bomb, 5000,

04:29.600 --> 04:38.480
9000 was the biggest one. And this 9000 means it is 9000 kilogram heavy or somewhere like that.

04:38.480 --> 04:46.800
So correspondingly, for a 9000 kilogram bomb, you need a bomb which can carry a bomb weighting 9 tons.

04:46.800 --> 04:56.520
That is the first point. The second point is, in order to make a glide bomb out of such a bomb,

04:56.520 --> 05:02.400
you need very big wings, big wing surface. And the bigger the wing surface, the further it's flying.

05:02.400 --> 05:09.040
Which in turn means you need the bomb itself is getting ever grow bigger and bigger.

05:09.040 --> 05:19.600
Correspondingly, there is a big problem already with the bomb in caliber of 3000 kilogram of 3 tons.

05:19.600 --> 05:28.720
The construction, this UMP key construction, this module which is installed on top of the bomb,

05:28.720 --> 05:36.120
splitting wings, so it becomes a glide bomb, is so big and so heavy that the bomb is weighting

05:36.120 --> 05:43.560
something like 4 tons. That means that a single SO-34 can only carry one at once, also because of

05:43.560 --> 05:51.680
its sheer size. It is not only the size, it is the weight as well, because you have to consider,

05:51.680 --> 05:58.320
you put a 4000 kilogram bomb under an aircraft and to connect it to the aircraft, you need a hard point,

05:59.280 --> 06:06.400
which is, we call this pylon in English, which can carry 4000 kilogram.

06:09.440 --> 06:16.480
And this pylon weights another 1000 kilogram. So now you have 4000 kilogram of a bomb,

06:16.480 --> 06:21.920
1000 kilogram of the pylon and then you put that on the aircraft, on SO-34, in between the engines.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.680
And you have, in this way, you have put 4000 kilogram on the aircraft.

06:27.680 --> 06:33.920
SO-34 could theoretically carry 8000 kilogram of bombs, but then it's going to fly for the next 200 kilometers.

06:33.920 --> 06:42.880
But because of the threat of Russian bases, they have moved SO-34s away from bases close to Ukraine,

06:42.880 --> 06:47.920
therefore they have to fly very far away, from very far away, from warground in similar places,

06:48.480 --> 06:55.280
and therefore they carry only one such bomb at once. So that is theory. Why? Because so far,

06:55.280 --> 07:01.680
all I've seen, the biggest I've seen as deployed, was 1500 kilogram.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.480
You're talking only about Russians or?

07:06.480 --> 07:14.880
Russians, Russians, just Russians. 1500 kilogram. It could be that they have dropped

07:14.880 --> 07:21.040
one or two, 3000, there are prototypes of 3000 kilogram heavy UMPK or carb bomb, if you like it.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.800
It could be they have deployed two or three of this, but I haven't seen any clear evidence,

07:26.800 --> 07:32.080
any definite evidence that there is such a weapon in serious production in Russia.

07:32.080 --> 07:39.440
At least not its UMPK module. There are 3000 kilogram bombs in Russian arsenals,

07:39.440 --> 07:46.400
and they are in production as well, but there are no UMPK modules which can be installed on such bombs

07:46.400 --> 07:52.720
and manufactured in serious. So most of the times they're actually dropping bombs,

07:52.720 --> 07:58.880
UMPK bombs or carb bombs, if you like, of 250 kilogram and 500 kilogram. From time to time,

07:58.880 --> 08:07.360
they're dropping those of 1000, 1500 kilogram. But 3000 kilogram, I haven't seen clear evidence for

08:07.360 --> 08:12.640
any so far. Even somewhere throughout the world, not only in Ukraine?

08:16.480 --> 08:23.520
When we're talking about around the world. Yes, the question is, are there any examples of

08:25.120 --> 08:32.880
applying such huge stuff, at least somewhere, maybe on the Middle East or somewhere else?

08:33.600 --> 08:39.520
Okay, I see now what you mean. Here we have to distinguish between bombs designed and manufactured,

08:39.520 --> 08:45.440
originally manufactured in Soviet Union, and nowadays in Russia, and between Western bombs.

08:45.440 --> 08:51.040
Why? Because Western bombs are made of parts which should assemble together as necessary.

08:51.040 --> 08:58.560
They are very flexible, they are modular, but they are construction. On Soviet dash Russian bombs,

08:58.640 --> 09:06.080
everything is welded together. That's it. Bomb is delivered to the air base as it was manufactured,

09:06.080 --> 09:12.000
as it was put together already in the factory. You can't change anything about it. So the question,

09:12.960 --> 09:18.720
fundamental question or the fundamental issue while developing the carb or the UMPK

09:19.360 --> 09:25.600
was how to make a module which you can put on such a bomb which is already ready for use.

09:26.320 --> 09:33.920
And this means that every different caliber of bomb needs a different UMPK module. This module

09:33.920 --> 09:40.320
must be ever bigger and bigger because it needs ever bigger wings so that it can reach this 60 to 70

09:40.320 --> 09:48.320
kilometers. Correspondingly, nobody tried to do anything of this kind outside of Russia,

09:49.280 --> 09:57.280
at least not with bombs bigger than 250 kilograms. North Koreans have a similar system,

09:57.280 --> 10:07.680
like UMPK, which is useful for bombs caliber 250, perhaps 500 kilograms. And I've seen them in

10:07.680 --> 10:15.440
use by Sudanese Air Force over Yemen, for example. This is also 7 years ago or something like that.

10:16.160 --> 10:23.280
So this is all I have seen in regards to Soviet-Russian bombs. Then it comes to western bombs. The

10:23.280 --> 10:28.080
situation is entirely different because western bombs are modular and you have you can put the

10:28.080 --> 10:34.800
same kit, so-called kit, on different caliber of bombs. You have bombs caliber 125 kilograms,

10:34.800 --> 10:43.040
125 kilograms, 250, 500, and 1000, actually 907, but let's say 1000 kilograms. So

10:45.040 --> 10:51.280
you put the same guidance kit and the same set of wings on different caliber of bombs.

10:53.200 --> 11:01.600
You can also use specialized casings or bomb bodies like BLU-109, this is this

11:01.600 --> 11:08.560
bunker-buster bomb of 1000 kilogram caliber, or 2000 pounds, as we have seen when Israel

11:08.560 --> 11:17.040
assassinated the Nasrallah. This is a specially hardened casing, which makes sure that bomb penetrates,

11:17.040 --> 11:22.240
you know, goes down through the ground, 20, 30 meters through the ground before detonating.

11:22.240 --> 11:29.200
But the guidance system and the wings system for this bomb is still the same like on any

11:29.200 --> 11:36.720
general bomb, caliber 250 kilometers, because these bodies are all very flexible and modular.

11:36.720 --> 11:44.480
So this is a difference. However, there are no heavier, at least not in widespread tactical

11:44.480 --> 11:52.960
service, no heavier air released bombs in western service or of western origin than 1000 kilogram.

11:53.280 --> 12:01.360
There is one type, this massive penetrator, whatever, 10,000 kilogram bomb in the United States,

12:02.160 --> 12:07.520
but this is carried only by B-2 bombers, and that's it, not a tactical aircraft can deploy it.

12:07.520 --> 12:14.800
So the heaviest bombs of this caliber are around 1000 kilograms in the west.

12:14.880 --> 12:22.960
Tom, what about Ukraine? Can Ukraine, for example, use our favorite F-16s to apply such stuff?

12:23.840 --> 12:27.760
Yes, of course. You could put two 1000 kilogram bombs on F-16.

12:30.320 --> 12:36.400
What do you think? Is Ukrainian command going to use it?

12:37.760 --> 12:43.600
Yes, you have already underdeveloped such a weapon. I'm just not sure if it is caliber 1000 kilogram,

12:43.600 --> 12:47.440
but you certainly have such underdevelopment, a weapon of 500 kilogram.

12:48.640 --> 12:54.400
That's very interesting. So let's stay on our favorite topic. Tom, how could you,

12:55.920 --> 12:57.680
what's your opinion of the

13:01.920 --> 13:04.960
using of western aircraft in Ukraine?

13:06.640 --> 13:12.880
Look, in order to use western aircraft in Ukraine, you have to change the entire system,

13:12.960 --> 13:17.600
how aviation is operating in Ukraine, and this is happening very, very slowly.

13:18.240 --> 13:27.280
It took the delivery of F-16s to Ukraine for the top civilian authority in Ukraine,

13:27.280 --> 13:35.760
I forgot the name, sorry now, to write a new set of regulations for pilots, for ground personnel,

13:35.760 --> 13:42.240
for ground control and so on, and for radar systems and so on. So before that, you still had

13:42.240 --> 13:50.080
the same system like in the Soviet Union. So now you have to, in order to use, the next step in

13:50.080 --> 13:57.600
using western aircraft is to teach your people, your troops, your ground crews and your pilots to

13:57.600 --> 14:05.200
speak English, which is the next hurdle because despite all the talk about we are going to buy

14:05.200 --> 14:11.040
western aircraft, whether a sub-grip pen or F-16s or whatever else, of the last let's say 10 years

14:11.040 --> 14:17.920
or something like that, nobody in the Air Force took here to organize English language courses

14:18.560 --> 14:25.200
for pilots and for ground personnel, which means that every time Ukraine sends pilots and ground

14:25.200 --> 14:32.720
personnel for training in the West, they first have to spend six months at least learning English.

14:33.360 --> 14:40.320
So now once they learn English, only then can they start training actual flying training or aircraft.

14:40.320 --> 14:46.800
Before they start this actual training, flight training on aircraft, they have to learn the

14:46.800 --> 14:54.160
basic principles, procedures of flying in the West, which are fundamentally different than those in

14:54.160 --> 15:01.120
the former Soviet Union. So even then, actually, they still do not instantly start training in

15:01.840 --> 15:09.760
aircraft, but they first learn the procedures and terminology in order to start learning flying

15:09.760 --> 15:14.960
aircraft or maintaining aircraft or arming them, refueling them and so on and so on. So you have

15:16.240 --> 15:23.520
every time a new group of Ukrainians is sent to West to learn flying F-16s or whatever else,

15:23.520 --> 15:28.720
it takes at least a year to get them so far that they start actually learning to fly the aircraft.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.080
Correspondingly, from this point of view, you can instantly calculate how long is it going to take

15:38.080 --> 15:45.920
for an entire Ukrainian Air Force to convert to, let's say, F-16s. This is just F-16s.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.680
Another part is going to convert to Gripens. At least a unit is going to fly

15:52.640 --> 15:55.920
this Sub-Evox aircraft and similar stuff.

15:56.320 --> 16:01.680
So this is a process that is going to take years.

16:06.160 --> 16:15.840
Can we say that today is too early to make conclusions about applying F-16s and other

16:15.840 --> 16:20.720
aircraft in Ukraine? It's not too early. It's not too early. Don't worry. Let's say,

16:20.720 --> 16:27.280
even if the Dutch would junk all of their 40 or whatever F-16s that are still around

16:27.280 --> 16:32.160
up on Ukraine tomorrow in the morning, it will still take you one to two years to train enough

16:32.160 --> 16:38.640
personnel to fly all of them. You do not have people enough people. Someone is already flying.

16:39.760 --> 16:45.040
Just flying over Ukraine. You don't have enough pilots. You don't have enough ground personnel.

16:45.040 --> 16:49.840
You don't have the support infrastructure. You don't have the spares. You don't have

16:50.720 --> 16:54.560
maintenance facilities in Ukraine. You don't have it. It's simply not there.

16:55.120 --> 17:05.840
You mean that those aircraft which already fly above Ukraine, they do not conduct any military

17:05.840 --> 17:13.440
mission? Oh, no. I do not say that. What do they do? There are five F-16s in Ukraine. This is the

17:13.440 --> 17:20.080
group that was delivered two months ago, and they are flying air combat sorties, air defense sorties.

17:20.880 --> 17:29.280
I'm not dispute about this. But increasing this number to, let's say, 30 or something meaningful

17:30.640 --> 17:35.840
to a number that is making sense or having its effect upon developments on the battlefield,

17:36.240 --> 17:51.040
it's going to take its time. Okay, that's clear. We also had a question that is being asked throughout

17:51.040 --> 18:02.960
Ukraine for about three years. Why don't we still have our own iron dome above Ukraine?

18:03.440 --> 18:15.440
What's about Ukrainian air defense? Where should I start? Well, I mean, you are Ukrainian. You

18:15.440 --> 18:19.440
know it better than me. You grew up in Ukraine, if nothing else. I've never been to Ukraine.

18:20.000 --> 18:29.200
The first problem is that from the independence in 1991, 1992, until 2014, nobody cared about

18:29.280 --> 18:33.920
Ukrainian armed forces. So they were constantly decreased, decreased, decreased, decreased,

18:33.920 --> 18:42.000
downsized, downsized. Units were constantly disbanded. Air bases were closed. Nobody needed

18:42.000 --> 18:50.880
armed forces. There was peace everywhere. Everything was so beautiful. And well, it's a matter of

18:50.880 --> 18:56.880
fact that Ukrainian economy wasn't particularly good. So you had a situation where there was no money

18:57.360 --> 19:02.480
for the city. And therefore, although you had excellent companies which could

19:03.200 --> 19:10.080
design a manufacturing weaponry, nobody was buying this weaponry. And so these companies,

19:10.080 --> 19:16.400
in some cases, ended working for the Russians and not only a few of them. So when the Russians needed

19:16.400 --> 19:23.200
some kind of guided, tactical guided weapons, air-to-air missiles and so on, these were made,

19:23.520 --> 19:27.840
at least major parts of them, major assemblies of them were made in Ukraine.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.520
And then the Russians would either use these at home or sell them abroad, export them

19:34.400 --> 19:40.800
to whatever customers. So now the 2014 came and there are lots of announcements and blah, blah,

19:40.800 --> 19:50.240
blah, blah. And nothing happened. Or the most that has happened was to overhaul MiG-29s and S-25s

19:51.200 --> 19:59.440
very few, F-22s, S-27s. So they were overhauled. That means that they were taken apart,

20:00.000 --> 20:05.360
cleaned, refurbished, most important pieces were replaced. And then everything was assembled,

20:05.360 --> 20:11.200
painted anew. And they received a new radio, they received new weapons management systems.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.200
MiG-29s have even received this new computer, which is improving the performance of their radar.

20:17.200 --> 20:24.640
Beautiful. Yeah. And that's it. Nobody came to the idea, obviously, to finance the installation of

20:24.640 --> 20:29.600
or development research and installation of actually serious production and installation

20:29.600 --> 20:37.600
of new air-to-air missiles on MiG-29s or S-27s. So this is the first point. The second point is

20:38.800 --> 20:45.920
in order to have such weaponry, whether air-to-air missiles or surface-to-air missiles,

20:45.920 --> 20:54.800
you should have had somebody who would manufacture them. Basically, you had several design bureaus

20:54.800 --> 21:06.000
like Luch, for example, who have designs of new air-to-air missile and its surface launched version

21:07.440 --> 21:13.760
with a range of something like 100 kilometers, which is something which your armed forces

21:13.760 --> 21:21.360
would need urgently right now, and then not in a few examples, but in thousands. But it's not there.

21:21.360 --> 21:28.480
Why? Well, because obviously, somebody there is convinced that these are old companies,

21:28.480 --> 21:32.800
that they are too complex and they're wasting too much money and doing nothing and they're

21:32.800 --> 21:40.880
useful and to whatever else. Therefore, nothing is done. And now, even if Luch would start,

21:40.880 --> 21:46.800
actually give Artyom the production to launch this production, the serious production of this

21:46.800 --> 21:52.240
new weaponry, it would take at least a year to introduce it to service. On the other side,

21:52.240 --> 21:58.400
meanwhile, Artyom was heavily hit several times by the Russians this summer, so I don't even know

21:58.400 --> 22:03.840
how much of its underground facilities are still actually operational. So why didn't this happen?

22:03.840 --> 22:12.080
Because nobody in Kiev had the far side enough to say, okay, guys, we have to build up,

22:12.080 --> 22:17.680
we have to invest into our defense sector, we have to reform it on time and then let it

22:18.560 --> 22:24.240
start manufacturing new weaponry on time. Nothing happened in these regards, actually, even as of,

22:25.200 --> 22:33.760
was it Autumn 2022, perhaps in Autumn the last year. And therefore, you do not have

22:34.800 --> 22:39.600
in serious production, you do not have new ballistic missiles, you do not have air-to-air

22:39.600 --> 22:46.880
missiles, you do not have surface-to-air missiles, although your companies have ready to use designs

22:46.880 --> 22:52.960
for them and they could put them into production. The next point is also that there is always this

22:53.040 --> 22:59.840
petty bickering about who is going to get the money for this. You have advisors to the

22:59.840 --> 23:06.160
government who are complaining that Artyom and Luch, they are old and this is too complex,

23:06.160 --> 23:11.680
and let's not give them money. Let's get this stuff from the West, which is nonsensical.

23:12.320 --> 23:18.960
It would have been better to pay Artyom already back in 2022 to start manufacturing this new

23:18.960 --> 23:24.000
air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles. However, the government back then was convinced

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
now this war is going to end, whatever, in the six months, 12 months or something.

23:29.600 --> 23:36.320
Therefore, you didn't launch production on time. Even the Neptune anti-ship missile,

23:36.320 --> 23:41.920
which is meanwhile also developed as a cruise missile, was available on in prototype form,

23:41.920 --> 23:50.160
some 12 or 15 examples around in February 2022. This first successful deployment against

23:50.800 --> 23:57.280
Russian guided missile cruiser Moskva was actually something like an ultimate test of the weapon.

23:57.920 --> 24:04.000
Before that, there was no operational unit in the Ukrainian Armed Forces operating

24:04.960 --> 24:13.840
Neptune's. And ever since, how many are manufactured? 15 perhaps a year. 15 a year,

24:13.840 --> 24:20.480
where you could need actually, let's say at least 500 of them, and probably then develop them

24:21.840 --> 24:27.280
into land attack versions, which could be launched from Asia 24, so you don't need to beg

24:27.680 --> 24:34.400
Germans, British, French and the Americans for more storm shadows and similar stuff.

24:35.360 --> 24:40.480
You could have had all of this already years ago. Your government just failed to reorganize the

24:40.480 --> 24:47.360
defense sector, to finance it properly, to launch the production. Right now, your defense sector is

24:47.360 --> 24:56.320
working with 40 to 60 percent of its capacity, which means actually that people are sitting there

24:56.400 --> 25:01.600
and working something like let's say four to five hours a day instead of eight hours a day in three

25:01.600 --> 25:09.360
shifts. This is insane. You're facing a war of extermination and your defense sector is sitting

25:09.360 --> 25:16.080
there and waiting for better times. Because there's nobody in Kiev capable of reorganizing

25:16.720 --> 25:23.200
the financing of the sector and then the management of the sector itself. Nothing is happening.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.680
There are always big announcements, but until somebody from the West comes in,

25:28.320 --> 25:33.040
pays a lot of money probably somewhere, and then invests a lot of money into one or the other

25:33.040 --> 25:39.280
factory, nothing happens. And that is why you don't have modern air-to-air missiles for your

25:39.280 --> 25:44.640
suhuis and for your mix, and why you don't have enough surface-to-air missiles, and why

25:45.600 --> 25:52.800
therefore the entire production and the entire defense sector's future functionality

25:53.680 --> 25:56.080
is under a big question mark.
